Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe…is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I’ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width…super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they’d be slippery, but my husband says they’re really not. The insoles are not as soft as his other pair (different style), but he says they feel like they’ll be more durable!So I’d definitely leave a 5 star review for the shoes themselves, but 3-star was given simply because they were not new, as described.', 'rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars'}]</td>\n",

If you’re into classic silhouettes with a modern twist, these are a great choice.Style:The platform sole gives the traditional Club C design a fresh, elevated look—literally. It adds just the right amount of height without feeling over-the-top. They pair well with everything from joggers and jeans to dresses and skirts, which makes them super versatile for casual or slightly dressed-up looks.Comfort:Surprisingly comfy for a platform sneaker. The cushioning is solid, and the shoe feels stable and supportive, even after a long day on your feet. I wouldn’t call them ultra-lightweight, but they’re definitely not clunky either.Fit:They run true to size in my experience. The leather upper is snug at first but breaks in nicely after a few wears. If you have wider feet, you might want to consider going half a size up, especially if you wear thick socks.Quality:Reebok did a great job with the materials—good leather, clean stitching, and a durable sole that holds up well. They’re easy to clean too, which is a bonus if you like that fresh-out-the-box look.Final Verdict:If you’re looking for a sneaker that balances retro vibes with a modern edge, the Reebok Club C Double Platform is a solid pick. Stylish, comfortable, and versatile—definitely worth it.⸻', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'These shoes are great.  Look great, comfy and for the sale price i got, a  great deal!

I will mention with these shoes they fit really well but the toe area is made of a stretchy material and almost feels like a sock/shoe hybrid. I was concerned they wouldn't be durable because of this but they are my daily shoes and they have no signs of early wear. The hybrid feel took a few days to get used to but now I actually really like the feel.

If you’re into classic silhouettes with a modern twist, these are a great choice.Style:The platform sole gives the traditional Club C design a fresh, elevated look—literally. It adds just the right amount of height without feeling over-the-top. They pair well with everything from joggers and jeans to dresses and skirts, which makes them super versatile for casual or slightly dressed-up looks.Comfort:Surprisingly comfy for a platform sneaker. The cushioning is solid, and the shoe feels stable and supportive, even after a long day on your feet. I wouldn’t call them ultra-lightweight, but they’re definitely not clunky either.Fit:They run true to size in my experience. The leather upper is snug at first but breaks in nicely after a few wears. If you have wider feet, you might want to consider going half a size up, especially if you wear thick socks.Quality:Reebok did a great job with the materials—good leather, clean stitching, and a durable sole that holds up well. They’re easy to clean too, which is a bonus if you like that fresh-out-the-box look.Final Verdict:If you’re looking for a sneaker that balances retro vibes with a modern edge, the Reebok Club C Double Platform is a solid pick.

Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe…is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I’ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width…super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they’d be slippery, but my husband says they’re really not.

I wore these to a baseball game to break them in and after mostly sitting, my left foot was killing me for a week. I tried loosening them, but no matter what the material under the tongue DRIVES into the top of your foot and hurts so much. That was two weeks ago, and I just told myself I need to break them in...

Since he needed the shoes now, I decided to not return them, but just wanted to leave this review to let others know what I experienced. Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe…is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I’ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width…super convenient and very comfortable!

The fit is comfortable right out of the box, and the cushioning makes them easy to wear all day. Great value for the price too. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a versatile and modern pair of sneakers!', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'Excellent shoes, the fit is perfect and the materials are quality. Looks great with jeans, shorts or joggers. Super comfortable and grippy. Adidas Rock 🤘🏼', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'It's very lightweight &amp; comfortable! The fit is great as I usually wear 9.5 (W) I bought a 9 (M) for my comfort. The laces untie while exercising, but overall good for the price that I paid!', 'rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'Comfortable, lightweight, and breathable. These are great shoes that fit snug against your feet making them great for all around activities. My only gripe is the design change. I had planned on buying these again because the inside of mine have gotten a little worn due to my activities but I noticed that the design changed a little (from three stripes on the side to adidas being spelled out)—personally I prefer the design on my current pair to the current design.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'Found these during Prone Deal Days at a great price and they had my size in Wide. I was skeptical on the type fabric that was used since it was different from what I was accustomed too. They turned out great! Very comfortable for my wide Flinstone feet. They have great support and because of the design of the laces they stretch for comfort but are also tight enough so I do not feel that the heel is slipping up and foe. I’m pretty rough on my athletic shoes and I’m looking forward to seeing if they are tough enough to last over 6 months without tearing overall I like the texture, color and most of all they are comfortable. I wish I had purchased 2 pairs or looked for another color in wide.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'Fits true to size. The design makes for slip resistant grip and excellent quality for walks in all seasons. The material is thin enough for breathability while still offering support. These shoes function as date night and workout options.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': '*Cons about the buying experience (not the shoes themselves)-  I was excited to find these shoes for my husband, highly discounted; but did not realize I was buying shoes that were already worn before. I’ve shared photos of what they looked like, immediately after opening the package from Amazon- just not happy about the fact that I thought I was buying BRAND NEW shoes, which these were obviously not! Since he needed the shoes now, I decided to not return them, but just wanted to leave this review to let others know what I experienced. Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe…is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I’ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width…super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they’d be slippery, but my husband says they’re really not. The insoles are not as soft as his other pair (different style), but he says they feel like they’ll be more durable!So I’d definitely leave a 5 star review for the shoes themselves, but 3-star was given simply because they were not new, as described.', 'rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars'}]</td>\n",

I find my feet moving inside the sneaker more than I would like due to the soft fabric that wraps around the feet.  The overall quality of the shoes is good, as one would expect from Adidas.  Since the shoe is made from soft fabric, and the color is black and gray, the cleaning should be minimal and should be easy.  Given the material that the shoe is made with, the shoe is relatively breathable and not trap heat from my feet like many all leather shoes tend to do.  The shoes feels light in weight and is a perfect pair of walking shoes.', 'rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'Great quality. Super comfortable. Seem to have pretty good arch support so far.

This shoe is surprisingly good for the price. Good cushion, comfortable, nice look.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'I always struggle to find shoes that I like so when I do I buy several pairs of the same shoes. I now have a couple of pairs of these shoes. The quality is pretty typical for Adidas. Decent but not exceptional. But I am not really willing to pay $150 or $200 for shoes so decent is just fine with me. I will mention with these shoes they fit really well but the toe area is made of a stretchy material and almost feels like a sock/shoe hybrid. I was concerned they wouldn't be durable because of this but they are my daily shoes and they have no signs of early wear. The hybrid feel took a few days to get used to but now I actually really like the feel. I wouldn't plan on going out and playing soccer or rock climbing in these shoes but they're great as daily commuters.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'Very light shoe. It's a sneaker so not really for jogging nor light off- pavement. Not a bad walking shoe.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}]</td>\n",

The all black pair has always been my safe shoe with black jeans for casual looks and they blend in nice for a casual work look too. I bought a pair of the 5x ultraboost about 4 months ago, and within the first month, they were already falling apart. the bottom of the shoe was slowly peeling off, the black around the edge of the base ripped off too, I've never had a pair fall apart so quickly.Fast forward to now, I buy the 1.0 because they're more similarly shaped to ultraboosts I've purchased in the past because I'm going on a long vacation and need great walking shoes. I wore these to a baseball game to break them in and after mostly sitting, my left foot was killing me for a week. I tried loosening them, but no matter what the material under the tongue DRIVES into the top of your foot and hurts so much. That was two weeks ago, and I just told myself I need to break them in... WRONG! They still hurt and my foot is killing me. Money wasted, and now I need to find a new walking shoe because Adidas' quality has completely tanked.', 'rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'These are amazing. They’re my third pair. They are lightweight, easy to slip on and feel supportive. They hold up nicely too.

Since he needed the shoes now, I decided to not return them, but just wanted to leave this review to let others know what I experienced. Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe…is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I’ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width…super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they’d be slippery, but my husband says they’re really not.

Since he needed the shoes now, I decided to not return them, but just wanted to leave this review to let others know what I experienced. Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe…is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I’ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width…super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they’d be slippery, but my husband says they’re really not. The insoles are not as soft as his other pair (different style), but he says they feel like they’ll be more durable!So I’d definitely leave a 5 star review for the shoes themselves, but 3-star was given simply because they were not new, as described.', 'rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars'}]</td>\n",

If these are wide (don't appear so other than saying it) I'm sure the reg 10.5 would have been too tight.There was mention/reviews of the short shoelaces...yeah, if you use all the holes it will leave you just enough to tie them good. No extra hanging lace to trip on.... Hence, they are jogging shoes!Laces also seem thinner and cheaper than most laces I've seen but also strategic.

I wore these to a baseball game to break them in and after mostly sitting, my left foot was killing me for a week. I tried loosening them, but no matter what the material under the tongue DRIVES into the top of your foot and hurts so much. That was two weeks ago, and I just told myself I need to break them in...

Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe…is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I’ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width…super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they’d be slippery, but my husband says they’re really not.

Given the material that the shoe is made with, the shoe is relatively breathable and not trap heat from my feet like many all leather shoes tend to do.  The shoes feels light in weight and is a perfect pair of walking shoes.', 'rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'Great quality. Super comfortable. Seem to have pretty good arch support so far. They are very breathable and just over all I would give these a thumbs up.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'Adidas tend to fit me better than the other brands. This shoe is surprisingly good for the price. Good cushion, comfortable, nice look.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'I always struggle to find shoes that I like so when I do I buy several pairs of the same shoes. I now have a couple of pairs of these shoes. The quality is pretty typical for Adidas. Decent but not exceptional. But I am not really willing to pay $150 or $200 for shoes so decent is just fine with me. I will mention with these shoes they fit really well but the toe area is made of a stretchy material and almost feels like a sock/shoe hybrid. I was concerned they wouldn't be durable because of this but they are my daily shoes and they have no signs of early wear. The hybrid feel took a few days to get used to but now I actually really like the feel. I wouldn't plan on going out and playing soccer or rock climbing in these shoes but they're great as daily commuters.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'Very light shoe. It's a sneaker so not really for jogging nor light off- pavement. Not a bad walking shoe.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'}]</td>\n",

The all black pair has always been my safe shoe with black jeans for casual looks and they blend in nice for a casual work look too. I bought a pair of the 5x ultraboost about 4 months ago, and within the first month, they were already falling apart. the bottom of the shoe was slowly peeling off, the black around the edge of the base ripped off too, I've never had a pair fall apart so quickly.Fast forward to now, I buy the 1.0 because they're more similarly shaped to ultraboosts I've purchased in the past because I'm going on a long vacation and need great walking shoes. I wore these to a baseball game to break them in and after mostly sitting, my left foot was killing me for a week. I tried loosening them, but no matter what the material under the tongue DRIVES into the top of your foot and hurts so much. That was two weeks ago, and I just told myself I need to break them in... WRONG! They still hurt and my foot is killing me. Money wasted, and now I need to find a new walking shoe because Adidas' quality has completely tanked.', 'rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars'}, {'review': 'These are amazing. They’re my third pair. They are lightweight, easy to slip on and feel supportive. They hold up nicely too.

Since he needed the shoes now, I decided to not return them, but just wanted to leave this review to let others know what I experienced. Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe…is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I’ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width…super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they’d be slippery, but my husband says they’re really not.

The color is beautiful and they fit just like all the other adidas shoes I’ve bought (that’s practically all I wear), so I’d say they are true to size. They are comfortable and are pretty durable so far. I’ve worn them daily all summer, including in all sorts of weather and dirt/gravel, and they are holding up great.Overall, great shoes like I’ve come to expect from adidas. Recommend!</td>\n",

       "      <td>So I ordered these shoes back in late May because I needed new shoes for walking and own numerous pairs of Adidas sneakers. Well these caught my eye and were on sale for under $40 so obviously I bought them! Well when they arrived I tried them on and they literally looked like I was ready for the circus because they were so big. I wear a size 7 to a 7.5 in my fully enclosed shoes. Since I planned to wear thicker socks and a killer sale price I ordered a 7.5. Well these have to be a men’s size because they were so big but comfortable. Well I went to order a smaller size and was shocked that they were double the cost. So I returned them and ordered two other styles in 3 different sizes, only to keep one pair in a size 7. I still wanted these but at the $40 price point, so I watched and waited. While waiting, returning other pairs, and reading ALL reviews I had a better idea of the size that would probably work. Obviously the size chart wasn’t accurate and didn’t help the first time. Finally after after 2 months the price dropped and I ordered the replacement pair in a size 6.5. I tried them on and they are still a little big even with thick socks on but not bad enough for another return. A size 6 would be perfect with toe wiggle room but these will work. They are extremely padded especially around the Achilles tendon and ankle portion. The cushion almost has a “gel” padding feel and surrounds the outer part of the foot. So my other pairs of Adidas sneakers range from a 5 to a 7! This brand doesn’t seem to be consistent with size but are worth it when you find your fit. These are noticeably heavier on then most sneakers but that is do to the really thick shock absorbing sole and the padding. However it’s not heavy enough for me to give up the comfort. I have clubbed toes on my left foot and this shoe doesn’t bother me. So in conclusion I went from a 7.5 down to a 6.5 and could’ve easily worn a 6! So I would suggest sizing down at least a half size down minimal. I expect they’ll last me at least a year or more easily with this being used as a primary daily shoe. So be prepared for a possible return or wearing thicker socks. I hope this helps and good luck with your purchase!</td>\n",

If you know, you know! The Velcro strap has lasted longer than expected and still holding on strong.

The color is beautiful and they fit just like all the other adidas shoes I’ve bought (that’s practically all I wear), so I’d say they are true to size. They are comfortable and are pretty durable so far. I’ve worn them daily all summer, including in all sorts of weather and dirt/gravel, and they are holding up great.Overall, great shoes like I’ve come to expect from adidas. Recommend!  \n",

       "600  So I ordered these shoes back in late May because I needed new shoes for walking and own numerous pairs of Adidas sneakers. Well these caught my eye and were on sale for under $40 so obviously I bought them! Well when they arrived I tried them on and they literally looked like I was ready for the circus because they were so big. I wear a size 7 to a 7.5 in my fully enclosed shoes. Since I planned to wear thicker socks and a killer sale price I ordered a 7.5. Well these have to be a men’s size because they were so big but comfortable. Well I went to order a smaller size and was shocked that they were double the cost. So I returned them and ordered two other styles in 3 different sizes, only to keep one pair in a size 7. I still wanted these but at the $40 price point, so I watched and waited. While waiting, returning other pairs, and reading ALL reviews I had a better idea of the size that would probably work. Obviously the size chart wasn’t accurate and didn’t help the first time. Finally after after 2 months the price dropped and I ordered the replacement pair in a size 6.5. I tried them on and they are still a little big even with thick socks on but not bad enough for another return. A size 6 would be perfect with toe wiggle room but these will work. They are extremely padded especially around the Achilles tendon and ankle portion. The cushion almost has a “gel” padding feel and surrounds the outer part of the foot. So my other pairs of Adidas sneakers range from a 5 to a 7! This brand doesn’t seem to be consistent with size but are worth it when you find your fit. These are noticeably heavier on then most sneakers but that is do to the really thick shock absorbing sole and the padding. However it’s not heavy enough for me to give up the comfort. I have clubbed toes on my left foot and this shoe doesn’t bother me. So in conclusion I went from a 7.5 down to a 6.5 and could’ve easily worn a 6! So I would suggest sizing down at least a half size down minimal. I expect they’ll last me at least a year or more easily with this being used as a primary daily shoe. So be prepared for a possible return or wearing thicker socks. I hope this helps and good luck with your purchase!  \n",
