        "review": "These are often called \"grandpa\" shoes because they look a little clunky but they are still the best shoes I have found for exercise classes and basketball in that they are extremely stable through the last and I have not had an ankle turn since I started wearing them yeas ago. The bottoms of my feet are sensitive with minor neuropathy and these shoes fit wonderfully and wrap the foot well. The pivot point is great for people who take a cardio, Jazzercise, Shine, or equivalent class in that it facilitates turns, spins, and rapid direction changes.I do have to get a full size larger in Nike shoes (in all Nike clothes for that matter). After a couple of months of heavy use these Air shoes will start to squeak, often quite loudly, well before they wear out. I simply remove the lining  from the shoes and put baby or other talcum powder into the tiny holes under the lining and work it into the holes. This has served me well for years to stop the squeak and it has the additional benefit of freshening up my shoes.I have tried numerous shoe brands over the years and the only shoe that came close to the comfort and stability of this shoe is the Strutter from Adidas, which is no longer made to my knowledge and didn't last as long anyway.One thing Nike could do better is to more firmlyvsecure the sole to the body of the shoe. The glue used by Nike to secure the rubber part of the sole is the first part of the shoe to fail, especially if these shoes get wet regularly from rain or wet grass or even puddles when going to and from your car and the gym classes. I can normally get 6 to 8 months out of the shoes and I have at least 8 one hour classes of various intensity a week (and I do my best to keep the bottoms dry!).For those who wear orthotics, these shoes take them well whether they are heel focused, toe focused, or cover the whole foot. I now wear Goodfeet orthotics and they are quite comfortable in this shoe.",

They\u2019re not just easy to slip on, but they also give him a little extra height with thick but soft soals!

        "review": "Honestly one of the best shoes on the market for wide foot people, if your looking to snag a simple set of running sneakers, in my opinion. Here's some in-depth info along with  pro's and con's:TLDR: Great quality shoes for the price, and easy to clean. Recommend to beginner and intermediate runners/hikers, experts may be willing to pay more money for increase of quality.PROs:- Perfect Fit. I usually wear 9.0 wide (USA), so that is what I ordered and it fit perfectly.- Comfort and Ease. I like how comfortable they are and they are easy to slip on and off (if you wish) by the use of the heel pull tab. The tab also prevents the heel from getting bunched in or broken when putting on the shoes, which was a frequent problem with some other brands I have owned in the past.- Easy to Clean, Quality Mesh. I have seen some reviews saying these shoes wear out easily or the mesh is easier to damage. YMMV but I didn't seem to have this issue and I've had these shoes for about a year. IMO I find the mesh to be much more durable than the cloth mesh most sports shoes have these days and much easier to clean, which is essential for anyone like myself, who often hikes or runs in forestry/mud.- Above Average Quality. As for the year timeframe, the 1st set was about 8 months of extreme use, then I purchased a 2nd pair which I've had for about 3 months now. This may seem like a short timeframe to some but for me, I usually have to change shoes every 6 months or less if they are lower quality because they get a lot of mileage and use. I still have the 1st set which I use as \"lawn mowing shoes\", as they are still usable but the tread does not get much grip/traction anymore for running. I liked them enough to buy that 2nd pair instead of some other brand/model.- Decent Arch Support and Sole Tread. You will find other shoes with the same or better, but I didn't see many that were this cheap in price.- Part of Amazon's \"Try Before You Buy\". Free try-ons. You can take up to 6 days to decide whether to keep/return if you wish, and only be charged if not returned by the 7th day. Day 1 is the day they are delivered.- Uniform in Color. The shoe currently comes in all-black or all-white, including the logo. YMMV but this is a pro for me due to work restrictions requiring all-black shoes, so I can also wear them leisurely at work if I choose (I'm a mechanic). Great for anyone with the same issue, or military, etc.CONs:- Not the most expert/elite quality shoe out there, but will definitely check most people's boxes for average needs, imo.- Cost is higher than one might desire for just simple leisure shoes. But as an avid runner, the price is about average. However, they are usually on sale. My 1st set was around 40% off which dropped it from $70-something to $43, which was worth it for me. 2nd set was about 20% off. Winter holiday seems to be the best time for sales price.- Tread pattern is smooth and circular, instead of rigid and square/triangle, in case that matters to you (in regards to rock climbing etc)Overall I was surprisingly satisfied with this shoe model personally, but your mileage may vary.",

While the insoles of the Brooks are more cushioned,the width of these won out for overall comfort. These are sized more in line with my typical experience of shoe sizing. I ordered multiple Brooks to try on and none was a truly good fit.I'm going to be doing a lot of walking, so I may purchase an additional insert but for everyday wear they are more than adequate without an insert.I'm happy to find a new brand, that has a dependable sizing system.Shoe quality:The quality appears to be goodArch support:arch support is goodMaterial thickness:SubstantialColor:blackSlip resistance:hopefully good I haven't been able to test drive in wet surfaces yetLightweight:yes, lightweight",

These are some of the most cushioning shoes I've had.  Granted, I'm not on my feel all day, but I probably walk more than most office workers.Cons: Nothing significant.Other thoughts:These aren't \"sneakers\" in the way that they make you silent.  The bottom of the shoes are harder than my Nikes, and make a little bit of sound when you walk on a hard floor.  Not an issue unless you're an aspiring ninja.The bottom part of the shoe (the white piece) is larger than your feet.  This gives more stability, but makes your feet look a bit bigger than they are compared with my Nikes.The top of the shoes are breathable.  They are mesh rather than a simple fabric like my Nikes.  As a result, they don't stretch as much.  Just a personal preference which one you like more.Finally - this came in its original shoe box and the box was a bit squashed.

        "review": "Very nice shoe. Well built & appears durable. I especially loved the soft ankle.With high arch/high instep and wide forefoot, these shoes were not a good fit for me. Despite being men's running shoes, they felt like a women's B width. There is zero give the way they are stitched making them super tight across the forefoot at the base where lacing begins, and I mean cutting off circulation tight!It's clear to me that these shoes are made for heelstrikers with narrow feet:1) Exceptional shock absorbing heel cushioning that gives rather than squishes;2) Very little forefoot cushioning but provides good toe-off springboard action.What I found peculiar is that Nike did away with the 3rd gas tube running front to back with this model. No middle tube made my feet feel like they were being forced down midfoot\u2014something that has actually resulted in stress fractures in the past\u2014because I AM a supinator (underpronation, which means my natural gait strikes along the outside of my feet).They felt \"corrective\" so I would NOT recommend these to supinators, those with high arches and/or high instep, and definitely not to wide footers or wide forefooters, or forefoot strikers. Shin splints (along with other painful maladies) WILL occur\u2014guaranteed!About me:  I was an avid fitness enthusiast years before I ever set foot in a commercial gym\u2014and that was 35 years ago. Since then, I went on to become a personal trainer, taught aerobics for 20+ years, and have worked in numerous gyms\u2014two of which I managed for some time.And for most of that time, I've been a Nike snob. However, their latest \"improvements\" on new models and elimination of older ones convey a simple message:  It's time to pack up my toys and move on. My groundpounders deserve compatible playmates.4 stars because I believe this to be a Nike typical, high-quality shoe. No 5th star because there is no mention or caution on the incredibly narrow width in a men's shoe, or the zero give with this new stitching, nor is there any information on the type of runner this shoe would\u2014or would not benefit.",

The Invisible Fit membrane keeps water out without giving that plastic-bag feel\u2014my socks stay dry, and the shoe flexes like a regular trainer instead of a clunky winter boot.Underfoot, Nike\u2019s new ReactX midsole brings road-shoe energy to mud, roots, and crushed-shell paths. I finish runs feeling bouncier than I have any right to on swampy routes. The outsole lugs and sticky rubber grab wet boardwalks and slick limestone with zero drama, so I\u2019m not tip-toeing every time a puddle shows up.Little design touches seal the deal: an extended ankle collar that blocks sand and pine needles, a 3-D toe cap that shrugs off rocks, and a black/grey colorway that looks totally normal at the brewery post-run. The only trade-offs are the premium price\u2014about $180\u2014and slightly warmer feet on steamy days. Thin socks solve the latter; the waterproof peace of mind justifies the former.Bottom line: If you want one shoe that handles ankle-deep puddles yet still feels lively on dry pavement, the Pegasus Trail 5 GTX delivers.

        "review": "I bought a pair of these shoes from a local store back in 2018 and loved how they fit my foot like a glove and felt so light on my feet for any kind of activity.  I went back to the same store a couple of years later to buy them again but they did not carry the same model.  I was very happy to find them on Amazon in many more beautiful colors than the two colors my initial pair were available in.  I had bought my first pair for $60 and feel that spending $100+ is rather expensive but it is also difficult to find running shoes that feel so good and I loved the bright color so I bought 3 more pairs to hopefully keep me in running shoes for the next several years.  My first pair has held up very well for me and have been washed several times so I feel good about the overall quality of the shoes.I have low arches and have had double bunion surgery many years ago so I usually exchange the insoles that come in shoes for insoles with an arch.  I did not need to do this for about three years with my first pair but lately began having some toe pain so I simply added added a gel arch under the regular insole and that easily solved the problem.I generally wear a 5 or 5.5 but a 6 fits me perfectly.  I also have narrow heels and these shoes gently hug my feel all around, giving a solid feeling of stability and lightness.",

These shoes are flexible thanks to the honeycomb like sole but it fills with surface matter. Great around the house and on the dirt etc but a big pain on pebbles, gravel and mud.",

Not just a random squeak but a every time you take a step it bellows a eery squeak like the front door of a haunted house. Wildlife creatures are running for their lives when I attempt to walk my local natural trail. Hunters are angry that I scared off the 8 point buck from a mile away that they've been staying all season. I seriously can't hide at work. They know exactly where I am and when I'm walking down the halls. I'm 5' 10'', 185. It's not like I'm hurting the shoes but they are screaming for help with every step! I know, I know. It's just a inexpensive pair of shoes that some hard working child in Indonesia put blood and sweat into producing.  I really do appreciate every tear that they shed to glue them together, but they missed a spot. The most important spot. The spot that keep the shoe from squeaking. So to everyone that's has to hear me walk in them in the local Walmart and Target, I'm sorry! I wearing them for your enjoyment (with earbuds in my ears) so you can have a laugh for the day.

I kept the first pair until i could wear the second pair.  After a couple times now the right sneaker started the same squeaking noise. I returned the 2 squeakers and kept the non-squeakers as a pair. After a coupe more times wearing them both sneakers have started to squeak. Will be returning the second pair this weekend.",

As I flew ybackward, I recall looking up at the sky, and to my surprise, I saw one of my brand new shoes flying by.  Next thing I knew I was lying there on the cold, hard sidewalk in such shock I layed there for what felt like forever. I slowly began to rise to my feet. I started to check myself for any injuries when suddenly I got a whiff of a nostril-burning foul smell. I reached my hand around to my back only to bring it right back abruptly.  I let out a loud scream followed by a gagging reaction to the dog poop that was now on my hand.  I ran to the grass and dropped to my knees I frantically began wiping my hand on the grass. As a tear ran down my face I remembered thinking can this day get any worse? Well, guess what it did! Behind me was a loud bark that scared me so much I jumped forward. I was now lying on the ground once more. As I got to my knees, I stood up quickly, eager to see the culprit that I believed to be the doggy doo doo bandit, but as I turned around to confront this demon, I promptly began to plead because in this dogs mouth was my other shoe I slowly began to approach this dog as I got close enough I made a daring move I tried to jump on the dog. I was unsuccessful with dog poop on my back, and with only one shoe on, I began to walk home sad and smelly.  Anyway I hope this helps your decision to buy these shoes or not",

White is a great shoe color and most running shoes look ugly in my opinion.I was concerned coming into this with how dirty it would look due to dirt, but it's actually very manageable. Simply throw it in the washing machine with some Oxyclean, air dry, and it looks nearly brand new. If excessively soiled, soak in Oxyclean overnight and then wash.The fit is true to size but slightly snug as you break it in. The entire front of the shoe is like a soft mesh so it's very comfortable, but that also means if you kick anything it'll hurt, trust me. The cushion is pretty good- an upgrade over non running shoes but not excessive like Hoka's. I can walk for about one and a half hours before my feet actually start hurting.Overall, would recommend. Definitely is kinda pricey but it's hard to find good looking running shoes so it's an L I was willing to take.",

I do tons of walking but don't drag my feet so the soles don't wear fast and I don't let them get wet, but it was time to get a new pair. These new ones are perfect in every way, absolute comfort, roominess, but snug enough fit with a good amount of comfort padding inside, and they have the exact size dimensions of the last size 15's I had from 5 to 6 years ago, maybe a slight tad wider for even better comfort. I love that they don't pronate (tilt to one side from overly spongy soles) and are even more stable for the ankle than the last ones. They also don't have excessive heel height which is a huge problem for me in this trend of making heels too high since i have ankle issues and had to have surgery on my feet at age 4, so I was told my my orthopedic doctor my feet could not handle excess sloping, i.e., higher heels. In this regard, it reminds me of barefoot shoes with a flatter more even profile, but still with good arch support and still perfect shock absorbing comfort (not excessive since I can't handle excess arches). Glad I came across the perfect fit shoe for me, though there is one thing I hope will last and that is four of the shoelace eyelets in the middle were done differently for stylistic reasons: they are put through some type of fabric loop instead of the leather that the other holes are made to go through. If those loops have stitching that fails at some point then one would have to resort to drilling a hole into the leather where it normally would go through because they had to do this \"cool\" looking style feature. Who knows, maybe it will last okay. The price is great too, and hope they don't read this and raise it!",

The weight feels great on my feet and I don't have any foot fatigue after walking 10,000-20,000 steps in them. The 12W are now too wide for my feet but I still highly recommend this shoe. They are easy to clean and still look good on the outside. On the inside, I've worn the heel area out.I purchased the White/Team Royal version in size 12. I loved these as they fit better as I've been losing weight. The downside, the inside cushioning around the heel and ankle is gone. Worn out.

The comfort was unexpected, the sole is very hard and uncomfortable to wear so if you plan for a long run or walk you will get pain in your feet easily.the design is nice that why I bought it online and think that its really comfortable to wear. One thing is no need to tie laces so its convenient. But the downside is its fit on the foot is way to tight.I therefore conclude, not to have regrets on buying is to buy from the physical store and have a actual fit to test its comfort, and actual design if its really satisfying or worth it to buy.",

If you don\u2019t have heel issues, they\u2019re a great choice for style and comfort.

What stood out the most is how easy they were to break in\u2014practically no adjustment period was needed. Within the first couple of sessions, they already felt like a natural extension of my training routine.The breathability is another strong point; the mesh upper keeps my feet cool even during long, high-intensity workouts. The stability in the heel gives confidence under heavier lifts, while the forefoot remains flexible enough for sprints, jumps, and dynamic movements. It\u2019s a rare balance of support and comfort that makes the Metcon 6 Free versatile for both strength and functional training.Overall, this shoe delivers on all fronts: comfort, stability, and ease of use.

I really put my workout sneakers through the ringer; using them 7-days a week for weight training and cardio (3.5 miles/day of incline treadmill). Aside from comfort, being lightweight, and accommodating wider feet (unlike version 5 of the same sneaker), what really stands out about these is their versatility. I've never had a workout sneaker (metcon, running sneaker, powerlifting shoe) that has provided ample stability to perform barbell squats while also being comfortable, flexible, and lightweight enough to do an hour of cardio in. I wish that they lasted me slightly longer than 5 months, but considering what I put them through, these are great value for the money.

Of course...I had to figure out how to convert from men to women but it was worth the extra effort. They fit me snuggly yet not to th point where I feel uncomfortable. These shoes are lightweight yet so comfortable that I absolutely plan to get a few others to mix up my styling. The laces are great at staying put...no need for double tying. They are easy to put on and Sweetie pie....you'll be in heaven because you will forget you even have them on.  I've received a few compliments from strangers about them. I am in love with a pair of shoes.... well worthy of every penny spent.",

I was skeptical on the type fabric that was used since it was different from what I was accustomed too. They turned out great! Very comfortable for my wide Flinstone feet. They have great support and because of the design of the laces they stretch for comfort but are also tight enough so I do not feel that the heel is slipping up and foe. I\u2019m pretty rough on my athletic shoes and I\u2019m looking forward to seeing if they are tough enough to last over 6 months without tearing overall I like the texture, color and most of all they are comfortable.

I\u2019ve shared photos of what they looked like, immediately after opening the package from Amazon- just not happy about the fact that I thought I was buying BRAND NEW shoes, which these were obviously not! Since he needed the shoes now, I decided to not return them, but just wanted to leave this review to let others know what I experienced. Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe\u2026is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I\u2019ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width\u2026super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they\u2019d be slippery, but my husband says they\u2019re really not. The insoles are not as soft as his other pair (different style), but he says they feel like they\u2019ll be more durable!So I\u2019d definitely leave a 5 star review for the shoes themselves, but 3-star was given simply because they were not new, as described.",

I get a lot of compliments on its looks.Fit: I wear a 9.5 Wide, typical shoe size. However, on my work out shoes I usually go up to a size 10. I need the extra toe box width. This size 10 feels a little tight to begin with, but it does stretch out pretty quickly. I did order a 10.5 on one pair and it opened up the toe box, but is a little loose.Durability: The tread is not very deep, so I find that I am wearing the grooves out in my major contact areas pretty quickly. I am getting about 90 days of everyday workout use before the certain areas are slick. The shoe is still very serviceable, so it gets relegated to a walking or casual shoe.Value: I could sometimes get this shoe for under $60. That for me is a great value. Similar shoes go for around $120 in my experience.I would highly recommend for an indoor gym / cross training shoe",

I bought the white version this time as exercise/walking shoes. They fit just like the black ones I had and is still great on my feet. I love them more because I bought these when it was on sale!

I appreciate the loops on the shoes to allow you to put them on with ease.I found them to be a little stiff at first. They definitely need a breaking in period.  But after a few workouts at the gym and a few miles walking on pavement, they've broken in nicely and are much more comfortable.  They're fast becoming one of my favorite pairs of shoes.I wear a size 13 mens, and the shoe is spot on for fit.  I also have a higher instep, and these shoes fit quite well.

        "review": "I started using these shoes on June 11, 2019.  At the time of this writing, that's almost 6 weeks. I'd suggest when you are reading these reviews you keep in mind how long the reviewer has been trying out the shoes; it can take several weeks to fully get used to a new shoe and reviewers who give hasty reviews (either good or bad) are not giving you the real picture.____________________In a nutshell, I got these shoes so I didn't have to spend a bunch of money on running shoes AND gym shoes. Nor clutter up my closet with too many pairs of shoes.  After using them for over a month, I am surprisingly satisfied.First off....I'm 6 foot and 175 lbs. My shoe size varies between 10.5 and 11 USA. My foot is slightly wide, with good arches.  I got these shoes in a size 11 and they fit great.  But not at first.....for the first 4-5 wearings they felt tight around the middle of my foot. At first I was disappointed and felt like they were not going to be a good fit. But after about a week of wearing them, they broke in just fine, and the fit now is great. I attribute the tight feeling to the plastic side braces that the shoestrings lace through: if you lace them overly tight, that will contribute to the uncomfortable feeling.My experience:  I have been running at least 3X a week for over 40 years. I've weightlifted and/or cross trained on a regular basis for over 30 years. I have been a personal trainer in the past (certified by ACE). I've run one of the toughest marathons in the world (Big Sur International Marathon), although I consider myself an average runner. I've used everything from cheap $40.00 Big 5 shoes for running to $130.00 Brooks. I've never bought a pair of shoes specifically for weight training or cross-fit workouts; I've always used running shoes for that.Here's how I wear them:- running 1-2 times a week. My average run is around 2.5 miles, but I've run up to 6 miles in them and they performed well. I would not recommend wearing these for regular runs longer than 3 miles because that's not what they are built for. I run mostly on pavement in California (moderate weather), although I just did a 6 mile run on trails in preparation for a 10K race later this month.  I feel like that was pushing the shoe to its limit, but it did fine.- stationary biking.- weight workouts. I do squats, standing barbell curls and overhead presses and these shoes are stable and don't shift. Of course you need to adjust the tightness of the laces depending on what you're doing and that's the cool thing about these - you can loosen them up a bit for non-critical exercises like stationary biking or tighten them up for running or squats.- kettle bell swings: again, they are stable and flexible.- burpees: this particular exercise really tests the stability, flexibility and shock-absorption of the shoe. If you've never done a burpee, I suggest Googling it to see what the movements are. In this exercise the shoe is subjected to squats, kick-outs where I land on the toes as I do a push-up, then they flex as I bring my feet back under me and jump up into the air, forcing them to not only be stable in launching me up but in absorbing my return to earth.I work out in these shoes 6 days a week.  The photo shows them as of today, nearly 6 weeks into daily use.  I typically run a couple days a week, do burpees 2x a week, weight lift 2-3 times a week, kettle bell swing 2x a week and do moderate cardio such as stationary bike 1-2 times a week.I didn't buy these to replace running shoes; I got them to use as short-distance runners and gym shoes. You shouldn't get these if you are doing multiple runs of more than 3 miles in a week - they aren't going to give the performance and protection you need for serious running. But for gym work, cross fit training and shorter runs, they are great and can replace expensive running shoes.You should note that the plastic shoe lace-ups/brackets on the side of the shoe have 3 positions. The position closest to your toes is the least secure/loosest fitting style. Each hole you lace going back towards your heel tightens the shoe's grip on your foot.  I use the middle lace hole for running and burpees and the stability is fine.  I lace it all the way to the back hole for squats to make sure the shoe doesn't slip.I've noted some reviewers say the \"sock\" collar around the ankle opening is loose.  I can say yes, it doesn't fit flush to your ankle when laced up, but that doesn't mean it slips! My foot is stable even if the sock appears to be loose-fitting. It isn't overly warm or hot, either (I was worried about that when I first got them).Again, if you're a serious runner I'd invest in good running shoes and use these for the gym. But if you're a casual runner of shorter distances and fit in weight training and/or cross-fit training, these shoes do a great job.I'll close by saying that in the last 20 years or so I've gotten wiser and have spent more money on running shoes, and with these shoes I've gotten my first shoe specially designed for cross-training also. I am happy with the performance of the shoes so far. I've never had a serious running injury, partially out of luck but largely because as my joints have gotten older I've used better shoes.  Good luck and good health to you!",

I am a lifelong NIKE customer and this quality is on point with the Nike brand. Very good heel cushion as I have some slight heel pain to deal with. Four stars for the design of the shoe laces. I have thin ankles and the shoe slips unless you thread the shoelaces through the second loophole at the top of the shoe lace row. I realize it is a 'me' problem and not a shoe problem - but thought it would be helpful to share how I solved this problem to make the shoe work for me. Also, the shoe is lightweight and cool - the bottoms are light colored. If you live in a very hot climate (like VEGAS) the asphalt is very very hot. If you wear a dark sole shoe it absorbs the heat and makes your feet so very hot. I would recommend wearing a thinner sock with this shoe if you are a runner/walker. It seems to enhance the comfort.

This shoe is super light (I don't lile bulky shoes) and can feel like barefoot at times. It performs really well on body combat classes for high kicks and jumps, it does well on weight training, and it is almost good for HIIT. My only negative for it is that it has very limited lateral support for HIIT training, and that it feels a bit too wide/roomy for my narrow-ish feet (I'm a 7, 117lbs/5'5\" and bought a 7). Also it slides backwards slightly for lunges, but not for squats. It also slides backwords for planks, so I need to place my feet on the mat to stay put.I did some light treadmill running in these and they worked for the lower intensity/short runs as well.Overall, I reccomend this shoe. If it's for walking / kicking around, these are super light and comfy and cute. If it's for cross training, these offer a very lightweight, responsive shoe (as opposed to the bulky ones with added whistles and bells) and it may surprise you that you will pick them every time for a quick gym workout.",

        "review": "\u200bRun, Don't Walk, Away from These \"Nikes\"\u200bIf you're in the market for a new pair of running shoes, I have a recommendation for you: run as fast as you can in the opposite direction from these. I don't know who made these, but I'm pretty sure their product development meeting went something like this: \"Okay, we need a running shoe that looks like a Nike, but is it a Nike? Absolutely not. Will it support your foot? No. Can you run in it? You can try. Should you try? Probably not.\"\u200bThe lack of support is truly a work of art, a masterpiece of structural failure. It feels less like I'm wearing a running shoe and more like I'm running on two very stylish, foot-shaped pillows. You know how some shoes have a heel cup to keep your foot in place? These have a heel suggestion, a gentle nudge that basically says, \"Your foot should probably stay here, but hey, if it wants to slip around, that's cool too.\"\u200bAnd let's talk about the midsole. I'm not a podiatrist, but I'm pretty sure a shoe's midsole is supposed to provide a stable foundation, not an expanding one. These shoes have a tragic flaw: the midsole has decided to spread out like a happy-go-lucky house guest who's gotten a little too comfortable on the couch. Every time I take a step, I can feel the shoe itself surrendering to the laws of physics, widening and flattening out under the sheer weight of my disappointment.\u200bI waited too long to return them, a classic rookie mistake. I was too optimistic, hoping that with each run, they would somehow magically transform into the supportive shoes they were pretending to be. They did not. Instead, they just got worse, which is honestly impressive. So, would I purchase them again? Not unless I'm training for a clown marathon where oversized, floppy footwear is a requirement. Would I recommend them? Only to my worst enemy. You've been warned.",

The downside is that the sole wears extremely quickly.  Nike suggests the sole should last 300-500 miles before the shoe needs to be replaced.  In my experience at least, somewhere between 150-200 miles is when the sole starts to wear down to bare spots.  Could just be me, but I've tried other shoes and I get a much longer wear life before they need to be replaced, so I'm thinking it's the materials of construction.  As I say they are comfortable, and I keep buying them, I just usually buy two pairs at a time since I know they won't last long.",

He loved the color/style of these Nikes and said they fit great but right away noticed that the left shoe squeaks everytime he walks on it. We tried everything we could think of to get the squeaking to stop but nothing has worked. Nobody wants to wear shoes that squeaks when you walk/run around in a gym or hallway. I figured since he had already worn them several times that we probably wouldn\u2019t be able to return them so we never tried. Also, the outsole toe part that wraps up came unglued within a couple months which makes me think that even though they are Nike, the quality isn\u2019t any better than other cheaper brands we have purchased in the past. I won\u2019t be buying these again.",

Shoes fit to size, great stability (at a cost below) have great toe box up front for those with big toes.  Great support on sides of feet, and using my orthotics give wonderful run support needed for dummies like me who jumped off things alot when young and feet are flat.  Within 4 miles these shoes felt really good on the treads.  Good weight room support and strong support on 1k rows.  My last shoes started really giving out on the rower, noticed that first.  But these feel really well formed and allow lots of power push on rower.  Only thing I do not like....  The same plastic bands that give such good side foot support is exceptionally painful on lateral lunges.... like being stuck with a stick...  Hopefully the plastic will flex better as it breaks in, as we all know OTF feels about lunges is like Rick Astley... Never gonna give you up.....",

I wear size 11 and they do fit to size length wise.I purchased these shoes in Black/Lucid Lemon and I absolutely love the bold Yellow color. It's even brighter than in the pictures. They definitely stand out! I have a lot of Adidas shoes but this is my first of this color, and they go perfectly with my Adidas Tiro 3 stripe black/lucid lemon shirt!The price was also a great value for Adidas brand shoes.

        "review": "This is my 3rd pair of this model (Interact Run). This is my 2nd pair of the white/day-glo green logo model. The shoe just looks great. I get a lot of compliments on its looks.Fit: I wear a 9.5 Wide, typical shoe size. However, on my work out shoes I usually go up to a size 10. I need the extra toe box width. This size 10 feels a little tight to begin with, but it does stretch out pretty quickly. I did order a 10.5 on one pair and it opened up the toe box, but is a little loose.Durability: The tread is not very deep, so I find that I am wearing the grooves out in my major contact areas pretty quickly. I am getting about 90 days of everyday workout use before the certain areas are slick. The shoe is still very serviceable, so it gets relegated to a walking or casual shoe.Value: I could sometimes get this shoe for under $60. That for me is a great value. Similar shoes go for around $120 in my experience.I would highly recommend for an indoor gym / cross training shoe",

What stood out the most is how easy they were to break in\u2014practically no adjustment period was needed. Within the first couple of sessions, they already felt like a natural extension of my training routine.The breathability is another strong point; the mesh upper keeps my feet cool even during long, high-intensity workouts. The stability in the heel gives confidence under heavier lifts, while the forefoot remains flexible enough for sprints, jumps, and dynamic movements. It\u2019s a rare balance of support and comfort that makes the Metcon 6 Free versatile for both strength and functional training.Overall, this shoe delivers on all fronts: comfort, stability, and ease of use.

Aside from comfort, being lightweight, and accommodating wider feet (unlike version 5 of the same sneaker), what really stands out about these is their versatility. I've never had a workout sneaker (metcon, running sneaker, powerlifting shoe) that has provided ample stability to perform barbell squats while also being comfortable, flexible, and lightweight enough to do an hour of cardio in. I wish that they lasted me slightly longer than 5 months, but considering what I put them through, these are great value for the money.

I wear this pair on my commute, which is 20 min of city walking each way.  The soles are great, very cushion-y - but the backs/heels TORE my heels apart for WEEKS.  Initially my fault for wearing no-show socks on the first time wearing these shoes, but even after weeks of walking, I still have issues.  I now wear higher no-show socks, but every couple of days, if the socks don't sit exactly right, the shoes still rub to the point of blisters.  It's almost as if the heel is TOO reinforced/stiff.  Blisters aside, they fit true to size, are SO cute, and very comfortable.",

        "review": "I am very happy with this purchase. I intend to keep the shoes & use them for the gym and PT. I am unsure If I will use them on the court for Pickleball however, or other sports however.  They seem more aesthetic than sports effective.  There is not much arch support. They are the same caliber as the Cole Haan  tennis shoes which are actually good & much better than Dooney & Burke which are definitely aesthetically designed.  The leather on the Nike is EXCELLENT.  Much better than the brands I just mentioned.  I could tell by the way they buckled  to conform to the crease of my foot on the first wear without breaking. They will definitely hold up a lot longer than most brands I have had. I am happy with the fit & was able to adjust the laces to fit the extra width of my feet satisfactorily which is not always the case.  Some brands cut the width short @ the base & before letting the shoe widen out to save $.  Nike did not do this & I was very happy with being able to adjust the fit.  The heel padding is EXCELLENT ALSO. This shoe fit durability, quality, sizing, fit, heel padding, leather quality, ease of cleaning, true to description & aesthetically pleasing! The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that These qualities were all so good that the arch support did not compare to their definite 5 rating.  So what could have been an overall 5 shoe in every category got uncharacteristically, almost unfairly downgraded to a 4 because of one  category\u2026. Arch support.  If all shoes could say that they would be 5\u2019s. I guess this is a rather critical review if all the categories are 5 except one.  I hope this is helpful.",

In general, products from this brand tend to have good designs. As for the size, it was exactly what I ordered. I think you should follow the advice given in the product description. For example, I'm a size 10.5, but they advise ordering one size larger than your normal size. So, I ordered size 11.5, and the truth is, they fit me very well.

        "review": "I have worn Saucony running shoes for 40 years, and have never gone wrong with a pair. My first pair was orange and garish, but on sale at an outlet. I was a poor college student training for a 1/2 marathon, and bought what I could afford. From then on it was love at first step. Like all the other Saucony shoes in my past, the Saucony Women's Cohesion 14 Road Running Shoe (what a mouthful) is a delight. I normally wear a women's size 9, but have a wide foot, so ordered a 9.5 US in this shoe. Good fit, good arch support, no rub at the back of the heel, nice stability against ankle roll on irregular terrain, nice sole cushion for heel strike and follow through, good flexibility at the bend of the metatarsal-toe joints. Good breathability...no sweaty feet after prolonged use (I prefer wearing socks). I'm not the fastest runner/walker on the block anymore, but these shoes still allow me to get out there and try. Plus, the black/grey/blue color scheme is attractive, even when wearing with casual slacks or jeans.Update, several years later: My previous pair of Saucony Cohesion 14 shoes are ready to retire. After regular use for several years, the front sole is beginning to peel back and my great toes are pushing forward in the toe box while running, wearing this area thin. I lace the shoes loose to help widen the toe box, and agree with other reviewers that the Saucony toe box on this shoe is more narrow than in past decades (I've worn Saucony brand for running since early 1980's). To adjust for the narrower design and different manufacturer, I ordered up from a size 9.5 to a size 10. I was skeptical that a size 10 would work because I normally wear a 9.5 running shoe. Right out of the box the new size 10's feel ok. My great toes are a full index-finger width back from the front end of the toe (see attached photo). This is comfortable. However the heel area is a bit loose compared to the size 9.5. I wear socks with these shoes, but as yet don't know if the heel will slip when running uneven terrain. The photos show the old size 9.5 (grey/blue) shoes compared to the new size 10 (blue/light blue) shoes. The length difference is barely perceptible, and the new shoes show the slimmer toe box.

The fit receives mixed feedback, with some finding them amazing while others say they're not true to size, particularly noting they're snug in the toe box. Moreover, the color receives mixed reactions, with some liking it while others report the shoes being discolored. Additionally, durability is a concern, with one customer noting visible scuffs and scratches, and stain resistance is poor.",

The sole isbouncy despite having really good arch support, and a nice flat safe sole.My feet don\u2019t hurt after being in them for hours as well.They wash nicely in a lingerie bag in the washer.

Still looking brand new even with daily use in a resturant.  They clean-up so well I'm shocked..  over all fit was perfect hugs where needed and provides good support for low tops. It has antislip feel to them but I'm not quite sure just how antislip they really are.  There's been times where they were little slippery but I'm sure other shoes wouldve been way way worse.I have NOT been paid for this review nor any other review so far. (I wish I would though).This is, as always, just and only my opinion thought my own eyes and felt with my own hands.  I take reviews serious, as I rely on them to make my decisions before any and all my purchases. So if you have found my review helpful please vote and let the other Amazonian Browsers get a better judgment of what to expect and how the product works.  Thank you for your time and happy buying.",

Purchased these for a Halloween costume and ended up liking them so much that I'll probably be wearing them after then. Nice conservative low-profile design white sneaker, well-made as you'd expect from Nike and if you typically get a certain size in Nike sneakers this is typical of all of their products. Every pair of Nikes except for some of the slip on's I have always worn a 10 1/2 and these were no different. They are comfortable, pretty much as any tennis sneaker might be, feels like an Adidas shell top or a classic Puma suede, but with a bit more support, and stiffer materials.",
