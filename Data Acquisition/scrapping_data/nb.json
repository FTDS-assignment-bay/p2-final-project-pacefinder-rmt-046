My last pair was New Balance as well, but these ones really stand out for their arch support and stability. I like the curved sole and how it sort of keeps you propelled forward. They are comfortable for walking, but really supportive during runs thanks to dense foam and good cushioning in the sole. Probably not ideal for veteran runners, but great for someone getting back into it, I strongly recommend these shoes.",

I like the fact that they are light weight, supports my high arch, and very comfortable.  I wear an 11X Wide and this shoe fits me perfectly without a sock.  The shoe is not as wide as my other shoes of the same size.  Where I live the temperatures are in the 90s or triple digits in the summer months so I'm not too worried about the sock issue.  I can order another color and go up to a 11.5 X Wide.",

        "review": "I'm normally very rough on shoes. These have withstood 4 months with no fraying or broken laces. They're very worth the value in my opinion. I'm very impressed with the durability and functionality of the shoe. I will more than likely be buying these again, if the ones I got now ever do wear out, or I want a different color option.The shoes are definitely meant for runners/athletes. The aerated front portion of the shoes ensures that your foot maintains cover of airflow which substantially cuts down on smells from trapped perspiration. Obviously, ordering a size 15 tells you that I'm a big guy. However, the sole of the shoes has been outstanding. The heel portion does not leave me sore and the ball-of-foot portion does not leave me feeling like I have pins/needles in my foot after a run.I put them through the test of all tests for wearing shoes. They survived 4 days of 17,000+ steps in Walt Disney World parks (Orlando, Florida) during the day. No intention of throwing shade, but I purchased a pair of shoes from Disney Springs at a whopping $150 dollars that didn't make it past 7 months - it was a big brand that has celebrity collaborations!As far as shoes go, and I'm not just saying this because shoes are normally so expensive for me due to my size, these compare with a pair of Asics as far as comfortability and durability. They don't quite meet Merrill quality, but if they tweaked the materials they use for the sole without sacrificing price going with a Vibram sole, they could be very close.",

        "review": "Overall, a decent shoe, but they don't seem to be great overall. The stitching in areas around the insole seems a bit weak and doesn't offer a ton of support. I wouldn't recommend for daily wearing, which is what I needed when I purchased these shoes, they're just not comfortable for me, but I will say, I'm a bigger guy, so that may be some of the reason. I will say though, I've had Nike shoes for years and daily wore them with absolutely no issues. I was actually replacing a pair of New Balance shoes with this pair, and after receiving this pair, I noticed immediately several differences, including the previously mentioned stitching, the weight was different, which I attributed to the different shoe model, but the logo was also different and looked as though it was screenprinted on and not a stitched on logo, which looked and felt cheap, almost like a counterfeit. I will say, the shoes have good grip, but I definitely feel it after wearing them all day. My feet stay tired most of the day while wearing these, but can't afford to replace them after only wearing for a few months. The problems with tired feet started day 1, so it's not a recent issue. They look good though and like I said, have good grip. I probably wouldn't buy them again, but I'm a unique situation, wearing them daily, all day, they might be better for working out or running, but for walking I wouldn't recommend. Very little support when it comes to foot sole support. I should say I purchased these on sale and I was able to receive them in 2 days, which was the main reason for my purchase.",

Finally one came on here and I was able to secure it. You can take them to local DSW to have them water and dirt proofed. They are lightweight yet great quality and very comfortable. The material is soft cloth and the soles are thick and sturdy. Only thing I would say is deeper tread is needed for all shoe soles to ensure better grip. These do not come with waterproof protection so take them in. It\u2019s cheap to have done. He loves them and I will probably buy this pair again for future when he outgrows this one.

I feel they run a little bit small, given that my last pair of shoes was new balance in the same size, comparing the two.The one issue is a design flaw in the toe, where an internal support causes the fabric on the top of the forefoot to wear quickly.

They have a ton of cushion and look like they're made of top notch materials. These are replacing an old pair of Nike Air Max which I've had a long time but recently running they have been hurting my feet and shins so I thought it was time for something softer. I'm a month shy of 51 and by no means a pro runner, I've been running for 7 months and I do 1.2, 2.4 or 3.6 miles at a time usually a few times a week. That said, on the first 1.2 mile run I put them through, they felt much better than my old Nike's and I obliterated my personal best for 1 mile and total time (1.2 miles total). I am very happy with the price I got them for $55 Prime, but would say they are definitely worth the regular price of $79 as well. Have seen a few different colors go on sale from time to time on both Amazon and the NewBalance website for what I paid.",

        "review": "60 yr old female with usually 8.5EE wide shoes. For the NB1080 I ordered the 8.5 xwide - not the double x. FIT PERFECTLY! Slightly rounded heel, rocker heel, caused me to step backwards at first to find my balance. Now I get it - this heel design creates a super fluid gait - remarkably smooth and gentle walking experience. The arch support is very good and feels perfect for easing my plantar fascitis. The cushioning is excellent - not squishy like crocs at all, just soft and comfy like no other shoe I've had.  Took a couple days for my hips and knees to adjust to being aligned properly but now I'm fully in love. Im able to walk longer and further than ever with no soreness anywhere just joy! Worth every penny.",

I\u2019ve had no issues with rubbing or blisters, and I didn\u2019t need to break them in at all. I went with my usual size and the fit was spot-on, with a bit of extra room in the toe box.If you\u2019re looking for a versatile sneaker that works for both fitness and everyday wear\u2014and especially if you need decent arch support\u2014I highly recommend these.

They are lightweight and provide good arch support, though opinions about support are mixed.

They provide excellent support for my feet, which is a huge plus since I\u2019m on my feet a lot during the day. The cushioning feels soft yet responsive, making them great for walking, running errands, or even light workouts.The design is stylish and versatile \u2014 they go well with casual outfits and even sporty looks. The fit is true to size, and the breathable material keeps my feet cool, which I really appreciate during warmer days.I\u2019ve noticed no discomfort even after wearing them for hours, and the shoes seem durable so far. Overall, these New Balance shoes offer the perfect balance of comfort, support, and style. Highly recommend for anyone looking for reliable everyday sneakers!",

I needed something comfortable enough for chasing after kids but supportive enough for workouts and these totally deliver.They\u2019re super lightweight, easy to slip on when I\u2019ve got my hands full, and the cushioning is amazing. I can go from school drop-offs to strength training without skipping a beat. No foot pain, no break-in time just all-day comfort.Plus, the clean white look is cute and stylish, which is a bonus when you\u2019re rocking leggings and a hoodie 90% of the time. If you\u2019re a mom trying to balance life and fitness, get these shoes. You won\u2019t regret it!I also recommend washing them on a hand washing or delicate cycle AIR DRY ONLY! If you need an easy stain remover I suggest also spraying them with dawn power wash before throwing them in the washer.",

        "review": "Comfort: The New Balance Women\u2019s Dynasoft Nergize Sport V2 Cross Trainer is incredibly comfortable right out of the box. The Dynasoft cushioning feels plush underfoot, making it perfect for all-day wear. Whether you\u2019re hitting the gym or running errands, these shoes provide great support without sacrificing comfort.Fit: These cross trainers fit true to size, but they have a slightly snug fit, which is great for those who prefer a more locked-in feel. However, if you have wider feet, you might want to consider going up half a size. The slip-on design with a lace-up front gives it a sleek look while ensuring a secure fit.Design: The all-black design is sleek and versatile, making it easy to pair with any workout gear or casual outfit. The minimalist aesthetic is modern, and the subtle branding keeps the look clean and stylish.Performance: The Dynasoft Nergize V2 is excellent for a variety of activities, from light workouts to everyday wear. The traction is good on most surfaces, and the shoes offer a nice balance of flexibility and stability. However, for more intense workouts or running, you might need something with more specialized support.Durability: After a few weeks of use, the shoes show minimal signs of wear. The materials used seem durable and should hold up well over time, though the lightweight nature might not offer the same longevity as more robust trainers.Conclusion: Overall, the New Balance Women\u2019s Dynasoft Nergize Sport V2 Cross Trainer is a solid choice for anyone looking for a comfortable, stylish, and versatile shoe. It\u2019s perfect for low-impact workouts, walking, or just everyday wear. While it may not be the best option for high-intensity training, it excels in everyday comfort and style.",

The colors and designs are always vivid. The laces don't stay tied well, even with double knots, and are tricky for new tie-ers to tie. I replace the laces with elastic, no tie laces.

        "review": "Apparently the corporate agenda has taken over New Balance footwear. These shoes are made of cheap material all over, like every piece of them.Let me explain, the top of the toe is flimsy and offers no support. It\u2019s like wearing a plastic bag on your foot. I\u2019ve actually worn plastic bags on my feet when I was a kid playing in the snow. We used to wear them under our winter boots so our toes didn\u2019t get soaked after the whole day of winter fun. These shoes feel pretty much the same as just the bag. No support at all, anywhere.If you haven\u2019t worn bags on your feet like me, maybe you\u2019ve tried on a pair of water shoes. They\u2019re about as supportive as water shoes. The  toe box doesn\u2019t exist. Side to side support doesn\u2019t exist. And the heel box is almost nonexistent. I mean it\u2019s there, (heel box), but for a company like New Balance to be selling shoes this cheaply made is not what I\u2019m used to from this brand. This company used to sell shoes that gave you.. well, good balance. Their shoes passed the twist test, were made of leather, and had support every where you wanted it, and even where you didn\u2019t know you needed it.The tongue is tiny, and bunches up between the lace holes exposing your sock from the top of the shoe. Not good.Laces came untied multiple times the two times I wore these.Nonslip capability\u2026well, they are somewhat nonslip. But I always use nonslip shoes, and out of my last 5 pairs, these are the worst non slip soles I\u2019ve had. You can tell they\u2019re better than a regular running or hiking shoe sole, but hoka, keen, doc Martin, sieka, and crocks, are all way better and safer.I would say a fair price for these shoes would be about $19.99.I\u2019m looking back at this review and feeling so bad because it\u2019s so negative. But really if you get these shoes you will see for yourself. I do plan on getting the upgraded version of these nonslip. They\u2019re almost twice as expensive, but hopefully they\u2019re worth it.",

My go-to the last few years have been brooks (ghost and Hyperion elite) but decided to give New Balance a try. I\u2019m so glad I did as these are the perfect trainer, and the price tag is a lot easier on the wallet.  They have great cushioning, great balance and lots of spring.  Going to go ahead and get a few pairs to have on hand.",

        "review": "The drop on the v5 feels slightly higher than the v4, but is still sufficiently mid-drop. I could tell when I put them both on one after the other (despite both being labeled as 6mm drop).The v5 wide seems a touch wider in the forefoot than the v4 wide, which is good for me.  I feel like the heel fits better on the v5 than the v4  (my heel is narrow-ish btw).  The v5 is also noticeably more comfortable overall to my foot.The TPU plate gives you decent bounce to your step and yet a stable feeling while the foam is still very soft & comfortable.  Very good combination.My only complaint is that there could be maybe a touch more space where my big toe goes on my right foot only (my right foot is a hair longer than my left it seems based upon my past experience with shoes).  There seems to be just a touch less space (either length, width, or height) at this precise exact spot in the v5 than there was in the v4, because I did not experience this sensation at all in the v4.Overall though, great quality for the price, there's no doubt.",

Now for these, they are a touch heavier than the Rebels, but I find them just as comfortable for daily wear.  I did replace the laces as I dont car for NB laces in general (tend to stretch to much for my liking).  Overall a great everyday shoe as I tend to gravitate towards NB due to their comfort for my particular foot shape. I will likely buy another pair if I can catch them on sale again.Highpoints:Sizing - Spot on with my SZ15Width - If you have a wider than \"normal\" foot get the wide sizeComfort - Very comfortableStyle - I dig plain these (also prefer mostly gray shoes)Value - Could not pass on these being $60 below retail when I bought themDurability - to be determined, while my Rebel v4's foam has held up well it has stained on the bottom due to road running and walking, but not a big issue to me.",

        "review": "I recently purchased the New Balance Men's Fresh Foam Roav V1 Running Shoes, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. These shoes have exceeded my expectations.First and foremost, the comfort level is off the charts. From the moment I put them on, it felt like I was walking on clouds. What's even more impressive is that there was absolutely no break-in period required. I wore them straight out of the box, and my feet were great from the get-go.One of the standout features for me is how incredibly lightweight they are. It feels like I'm hardly wearing shoes at all. This makes them perfect not only for running but also for everyday wear. Whether I'm hitting the pavement or just going about my daily activities, these shoes provide the support and comfort I need.Another huge plus is how breezy and cool they keep my feet, even during warm weather. The ventilation in these shoes is top-notch, and it really helps in preventing that uncomfortable sweaty feeling. My feet stay cool and fresh throughout the day.And let's not forget about style. These shoes are not only functional but also incredibly stylish. I've received compliments on their sleek design, and they easily pair with both athletic wear and casual outfits. They're versatile enough to suit any occasion.In conclusion, the New Balance Men's Fresh Foam Roav V1 Running Shoes are a winner in my book. They check all the boxes for comfort, style, and ease of wear. If you're looking for a pair of running shoes that deliver on every front, look no further. These shoes are a game-changer, and I highly recommend them to anyone in need of both performance and style in their footwear.",

Too hard to keep clean!! LOL..And, sometimes I would even complain \u2013Hey! New Balance! Love your sneakers!! But can you please stop with the new model numbers every few weeks? Good Lord! The 608s became 623s, and on and on!!Hey, New Balance!!! I just want a pair of sneakers, not a Bingo game!! LOL..Anyway, I went shopping on Amazon for a new pair of New Balance sneakers.. No white.. I wanted a pair with some color that would not need to be scrubbed with a \u2018Mr. Clean Magic Eraser\u2019 every time I walked on my lawn to fill the birdfeeder..And I saw these sneakers..New Balance Dynasoft Tektrel V1 Trail Running Shoes..And I fell in love!New Balance was offering them in a variety of colors, but the \u2018Black Phantom Magnet\u2019 color really appealed to me, so I took a chance and ordered a pair..Couple of notes \u2013** I ordered these on December 12, and they just came on February 4.. But they were worth the wait!** Fit is -as always from New Balance - as expected!** Superb quality materials and construction, as always!** My pics cannot do these sneakers justice.. They are simply wonderful, and they look great \u2013 even out of the box before I bothered tying the laces!!** I cannot rate their performance on a hiking trail yet, but the \u2018design of the soles\u2019 on these sneakers looks to be \u2018aggressive\u2019 enough to handle many different surfaces, providing excellent traction while also providing support and comfort to the foot..** The \u2018lacing structure\u2019 of these sneakers is really cool!! The laces lace up at both the \u2018tongue\u2019 of the sneaker and the sides of the sneaker all the way down to the top of the sole.. The whole thing looks nice and I would imagine also provides extra support..Bottom Line \u2013 I highly recommend these sneakers! Another great product by the legendary New Balance! 5 Stars!!!",

My feet feel locked in without being constricted, allowing for confident strides whether I'm climbing or descending. The cushioning feels just right, absorbing impact without sacrificing responsiveness.And the price? Absolutely spot on. I feel like I got a premium trail running shoe without breaking the bank, which is always a win. My only minor critique, and it's a small one, is that they're a little tight on the side of my feet. While the overall snugness is a positive, I do notice a slight pressure on the sides after longer runs. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, and I'm hoping they'll loosen up just a touch with more wear. Despite that minor quibble, I'm genuinely thrilled with my New Balance trail running shoes. They're a comfortable, stylish, and affordable option for anyone looking to hit the trails with confidence. I highly recommend them!",

I'm an older runner and need the cushioned shoes for the down hills. But these have a much better outsole like a proper trail runner should have. Not quite as wide as the X More Trail V3 but it does not seem to be an issue. I may edit this after 250 miles to say how well they are wearing. I have 416 miles on the X More Trail V3 and they are still comfortable but they are wearing out a little but I think these should last as long or longer.",

        "review": "I have two pairs of this shoe, I bought my first pair after trying them on in a store and I immediately loved the way they felt. I bought my second pair (pictured) from Amazon because the colors are nice, and I needed another pair to use exclusively outside of work. I'm very tempted to buy a few other colors. My other pair is black and white, and I appreciate how the black is slightly purple and the white is slightly grey. Anyway, it's great these shoes caught my eye because they don't just look good. The soles have a soft cushiony feeling and the uppers live up to their name: \"FantomFit.\" They are my favorite shoes for 12 hr shifts as a bedside RN, setting PRs in 1mi and 5k, and going out for food, drink, etc. Although these shoes are cushy, they are also responsive and fast. When running shorter distances I simple don't think much about them and they help me do my thing and yes it's in these shoes I broke my records for 1mi and 5k despite owning carbon shoes Nike Vaporfly 3 and Fuelcell Supercomp Elite v3. Probably because I'm more likely to take these shoes out daily. There are however two things I don't like about these shoes: 1) the upper material seems prone to abrasion, and 2) I'd get sore on long distance. I washed my 1st oair once and used a brush on the upper of the right shoe, little broken fabric filaments are now visible all over the upper hence I simply did not scrub the left one. In general both my pairs do not show much signs of other wear so I think the main thing is to not scrub the uppers. My second issue is that I could run more than 17.3 miles in these shoes. I had bad upper foot pain on two of my long runs in training for my first marathon in December 2024. I suspect, the upper foot pain may have been caused by form modifications from other pain on my soles then knees. Because of this the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 won the toss-up for my marathon shoes. With that said, 17.3 miles is quite a long distance already and there could have been other factors that may have contributed to my pain. I must mention that the Adios is a dedicated road-running shoe and is more expensive. I wouldn't want to work a 12 hour shift in them because they feel funny when not running. I also must mention that these shoes are awesome on the treadmill as well as the road/sidewalk. While $140 isn't cheap, I consider it a good value for how good they are and how how they compare to more expensive shoes.",

From the first run, I noticed how lightweight they felt \u2014 almost like wearing racing flats, but with enough cushioning to keep my legs fresh even after back-to-back days.The FuelCell foam delivers an energetic, responsive feel that makes pushing the pace effortless. Whether I\u2019m doing an easy run or throwing in some tempo miles, these shoes handle both without missing a beat. The upper is breathable and hugs the foot well without feeling restrictive, which is especially nice on warmer days.Traction is solid on both pavement and light gravel paths, and after a few weeks of daily use, the outsole is holding up well. I also appreciate the balance between speed and comfort \u2014 it\u2019s rare to find a shoe that\u2019s this quick but still keeps your feet feeling good after multiple miles.Pros:Extremely lightweight and responsiveFuelCell foam provides both speed and comfortBreathable upper keeps feet coolGreat for daily training and faster runs alikeSolid grip and durability for road runningCons:Minimal stability \u2014 not ideal if you need extra supportOutsole may wear faster for heavier runners or rough terrain useBottom Line:If you want a daily trainer that feels like a performance shoe, the FuelCell Rebel V4 is a winner. Perfect for runners logging steady mileage who want to stay light on their feet without sacrificing comfort.",

        "review": "Historically New Balance only makes certain shoe models with their extra wide sizing.  The retro/fashionable models haven't usually been included in that bucket.  So when I saw these new 515's on my BIL's also wide feet and saw them being offered with this many colorways, on Amazon, for less than $100, it seemed too good to be true.I know I'm writing this like I'm about to bring up a big \"but\" with these shoes...  But I'm actually not.  They're actually extremely well made, breathable in the summer heat and surprisingly comfortable, even with just an EVA midsole and thin hard rubber outsole.  I'm also one of those weird goth kids from the 90's who proved it wasn't just a phase, so the minimalist blacked-out colorway also gave me a bit of the fizz.  The wider 4E fit and footprint is also identical to what I'm used to with my other New Balance faves (the 410v5 dark Trail Runners) but the materials feel even more substantial and quality.  Though I will admit that the sole response of the 515's is less springy and athletic-feeling than those kicks.That said, I've been wearing these shoes a LOT this summer and they haven't disappointed yet.  The leather has held up and stayed clean with no fraying at the seams or obvious signs of wear inside or out.  The midsole has well broken into the shape of my foot and toes, providing a decent amount of support and grip without looking agressively athletic.  Which seems to leave the 515's striding a happy line between looks and functionality that have made them my go-to running around town shoes going forward.If you have wide feet, you could do a lot worse.",

Surprise, surprise, they fit perfectly, my feet hurt way less, and I don't look like Quasimodo Frankenstein after having broken them in. No blown out sides and I might just try the \"extra wide\" option next buy. Thanks for offering \"Wide\" options and sizing options higher than 12, and at an affordable price New Balance and Amazon!",

        "review": "I am thoroughly amazed and grateful these are just what I needed. My last pair of NB were walking shoes and was last bought 5 or 6 years ago. I do tons of walking but don't drag my feet so the soles don't wear fast and I don't let them get wet, but it was time to get a new pair. These new ones are perfect in every way, absolute comfort, roominess, but snug enough fit with a good amount of comfort padding inside, and they have the exact size dimensions of the last size 15's I had from 5 to 6 years ago, maybe a slight tad wider for even better comfort. I love that they don't pronate (tilt to one side from overly spongy soles) and are even more stable for the ankle than the last ones. They also don't have excessive heel height which is a huge problem for me in this trend of making heels too high since i have ankle issues and had to have surgery on my feet at age 4, so I was told my my orthopedic doctor my feet could not handle excess sloping, i.e., higher heels. In this regard, it reminds me of barefoot shoes with a flatter more even profile, but still with good arch support and still perfect shock absorbing comfort (not excessive since I can't handle excess arches). Glad I came across the perfect fit shoe for me, though there is one thing I hope will last and that is four of the shoelace eyelets in the middle were done differently for stylistic reasons: they are put through some type of fabric loop instead of the leather that the other holes are made to go through. If those loops have stitching that fails at some point then one would have to resort to drilling a hole into the leather where it normally would go through because they had to do this \"cool\" looking style feature. Who knows, maybe it will last okay. The price is great too, and hope they don't read this and raise it!",

I rotate them with another pair that I bought on Oct. 27, 2024, which has helped reduce the wear and tear. I removed the insoles and replaced them with PowerStep ProTech Control Orthotic Insoles and my feet feel great. The weight feels great on my feet and I don't have any foot fatigue after walking 10,000-20,000 steps in them. The 12W are now too wide for my feet but I still highly recommend this shoe. They are easy to clean and still look good on the outside. On the inside, I've worn the heel area out.I purchased the White/Team Royal version in size 12. I loved these as they fit better as I've been losing weight. The downside, the inside cushioning around the heel and ankle is gone. Worn out. I guess roughly 2,000,000 steps is a bit too much for this pair. Nonetheless, I do recommend these 608s.",

I have a straight lasted, narrow foot; very neutral gait; normal arch and no structural or biomechanics abnormalities other than boney ankles. I bought these NB Hierro trail shoes in the low cut version and they turned out to be my favorite trail shoes ever! And they have great durability - after a year and a half of regular use, they\u2019re still going strong (I alternate several pairs of shoes at a time to extend their mileage), but I\u2019m soon ready to retire them to be yardwork shoes. So I wanted to try these with a slightly higher ankle to keep the dirt & debris out better. I was a bit nervous because my ankles are so boney, so high tops often dig in. But these don\u2019t! \ud83d\udc4fThese are truly waterproof and have a gusseted tongue. They\u2019re very comfortable, responsive and cushioned - every bit as responsive and cushioned as the low cut version. They\u2019re light weight and very grippy, but you can still feel the road/trail for agility. And I really love the colors! It\u2019s a very cold gray, almost blueish grey. The lavender with dark pink accent colors are beautiful. They aren\u2019t too dark to wear in the summer, and they\u2019re attractive without being too bold so they don\u2019t clash with most outfits. These aren\u2019t nearly as hot as my winter hiking boots that are actual hiking boots and not just high top trail shoes. It\u2019s so nice to have both!There\u2019s only two negatives, which the low cut ones don\u2019t have. The toe shield on these is just leather, not hardened for extra protection like the low cut version. And you do have to be careful about how you lace these because the tongue is just barely wide enough, and something can dig in if you don\u2019t get it just right. I rethreaded one hole on the left shoe from under to over, and it\u2019s much better.I still wear Nike Vomero\u2019s on the road, but these are my favorites for the trails! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70",

There were lots of puddles, mud, and lots of places to slip.Tested water resistance when I sank into a muddy puddle. My foot got wet, but dried quickly. The traction was good when we had to cross large puddles on wobbly fallen branches.My feet stayed cool throughout the whole hike! I was impressed, even when it was pretty hot and humid out.Overall, these shoes are everything I needed them to be; cool, comfortable, cute, and supportive of my ankles and feet.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Original:I\u2019ve been on quite the hunt for a shoe that offered good ankle support, that\u2019s breathable for the summer, and something at least semi-cute. In the world of hiking, cute is not in the manufacturer\u2019s vocabulary\u2026 at least nothing that is reasonably affordable. I\u2019m pleased that these check all those boxes.I ordered these in a half size larger and in wide since I read several reviews about these being tight all over. The half size and width make these very comfortable and allow me to add thick socks for wetter and colder seasons! So plus!Bought these for an upcoming camping trip where there will be light hiking, but being pregnant, I need breathable shoes for the humid Texas heat. Haven\u2019t had a chance to test them out yet, but will update me them after I get a chance to put them to the test.It\u2019s worth noting that the rim of the ankles are stiff and does need to be broken in.

The sole of my foot started hurting. No support for the side either. I put on one of my old, worn down shoes and the new one on the other foot.

        "review": "I had these shoes for  just ten years inured before I decided they are the best running shoes I have ever had by FAR.  Here are some observations.  The quality of the materials is excellent, perhaps other than the shoe laces that are just standard.  The fit, I wear an 11.5 wide was very nice.  I would say they may run slightly large, and by that I mean length, not width.  At any rate they are an excellent fit.  However the premium part of these shoes for me is the density of the sole.  Often shoes are described as walking on clouds but to me that means overly soft, these shoes have a firmness and give combination that is extremely comfortable for me.  I\u2019m shocked at how good they feel.  One small note just to be fair, the insoles in these are suprizingly minimal.  I\u2019ll probably replace them with something else.  Also the drop, that\u2019s the difference in the height of the heel and the forefoot feels like 0 which I like a lot,  some running shoes have a huge drop and feel like you are walking downhill.  I like these much better.  Hope this helps.  Oh one more thing, they are expensive but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get enough wear out of their quality to make up for the cost.",

        "review": "This is my first pair of New Balance running shoes. I've been running for over 15 years and have mainly stuck with Asics and Brooks as my primary trainers. Obviously the 520's are a budget pair of running shoes and are not going to be as nice or as durable as a more expensive flagship pair, but I've purchased many $40-60 Asics and these are fairly comparable. The 520 v8's are very light shoes with a neutral fit and a smooth tread. They make excellent racing shoes, but aren't a great option for longer distances. These shoes feel very stiff to me, more so than any of my Asics within this price range ($54). But take that with a grain of salt as my other pair of shoes right now are the Hoka Mach 5's ($160) that are by far the most comfortable, cushy shoes I've ever had. These are a great light shoe for runs under 5-6 miles at a time. I've found they start to lose cushion and get pretty hard after that. I tried a half marathon in these and wished I would have brought a second pair for the second half. They started to feel hard around mile 6 and by mile 8-9 they'd lost all cushion.In terms of longevity, I don't see these shoes making it much past 250miles. But again as a budget pair, that stacks up to the competition. I've been able to average around 300 miles in my \"cheaper\" Asics. They now have 100 miles on them, and so far they've visibly held up well, but already have a permanent crease in the mid-sole. The tread is holding up great with slight wear on the toe. The mesh, laces, and even the interior are all holding up well with no wear holes in the heel. (Like every pair of Asics get) I do have some light staining on the mesh / outside of the shoe, but of course being such a light color that's going to happen with outdoor running in the winter. I actually prefer these shoes for outdoor running over the treadmill. They're light and feel great as a fast shoe, but they're just lacking cushion for long runs or treadmill running. I also second the review talking about long laces. These shoes have the longest laces I've ever had on a pair of shoes. I mean annoyingly long; but you could always replace them easily. So far I've enjoyed these shoes enough to own another pair of New Balance running shoes, but my next \"budget\" pair will be Asics again.",

I work in a medical setting and can be on my feet anywhere between 6 to 12 hours a day. I also use them for yardwork outside and long walks. I not only enjoy the support they give underneath my foot, but also the sides.I have arthritis in both knees and between regular chiropractic adjustments and these shoes, it keeps the flareups to a minimum.

These shoes are plenty roomy in the toebox, have a nice colorway, the laces are thin and stay tied, and the gusseted tongue is thin, comfortable and stays right where it should. The shoes are highly ventilated and breathable, not to mention extremely light, bouncy, and fast! I do have some gripes with the seller, though. I ordered from Fast Goods and when they got to me, there was only the inner box portion, no lid, and it was beat up pretty badly. I could definitely tell the shoes had been tried on/worn, and were certainly a return or a regret for somebody else. I loved them so much, though, and got them at such a great price, that I was willing to keep them despite all that. I just didn't find it very professional of the seller to sell them as \"brand new\" when they really weren't, so be aware of that. I couldn't find the rose and white colorway elsewhere or at such a good price, so I cut my slight losses on brand new shoes and kept them, because they are truly a comfortable and amazing shoe. I intend to get at least 300 miles out of them if possible!",

Most I either tried on in the store or purchased and wore for a few minutes before returning. Others I thought worked until discovering after a few weeks that they weren't right. I have metatarsalgia and Morton's Neuroma in one foot and have tried the shoes recommended by foot specialists. I need wide shoes for both toe box room and metatarsal comfort not constricting the outer edge of my foot. However, all these shoes resulted in some ball of foot soreness. I do Jazzercise, which involves jogging in place, jumping, lunging, balancing on one foot, and plenty of other footwork. It's important that my weight be placed primarily in the heel and arch to minimize impact to my forefoot. Only the FuelCell Rebel V3s have resulted in zero soreness during and after a class. They are light and springy to boot. When I stand for a long period, I am aware that there is no pressure on the ball of my foot or toes (and why I don't feel pain or soreness). In fact, I had to wear a pair of fancy stage shoes last weekend that hurt my foot. Afterwards, I put on these NBs, and my foot felt better within minutes. I've worn them for the past three weeks and want to purchase another pair. I only intended to wear these shoes to workouts but find myself in them almost daily because my feet feel so dang good.",

These fit the bill, being able to accommodate both and affording a decent amount of lateral stability compared to others. Most importantly, I can get the carbon plates and orthotics into these and still get a decent heel lock without having to ratchet down the laces. I other words, the depth in the heel is great as well s the amount of cushion in the heel stay. I wish more shoes had a similar build to afford such a great fit in the heel when custom orthotics and such are in the mix.That said, the toe box could be a bit wider up front,  like a more natural foot shape (and ideally a straighter last on the outside of the mid foot. The New Balance Kaiha Road feels better in the lateral mid foot area, and is cushy, but lacks the lateral stability that this shoe provides). The heel could be more stable laterally, but it's better than a host of others I have tried and checks all the major boxes for my needs. e.g., The Hoka Bondi 8 is more stable laterally, but lacks the heel lock with the carbon plate and orthotics in the mix.",

New Balance is one of those brands.  Consistently reliable fit, always comfortable footbed, and made of durable and eye-catching materials.  This 680v3 is no exception.  The cushioning and construction support the foot well despite the workout load.  The toe box is sufficiently roomy.  Cushioning under the heel pocket and the metatarsal is substantial, yet it retains good motion control (lateral) for varied activities.  Removable footbed allows for orthodicts or foot beds with more cushioning.  But I have to say, this sneaker was comfortable right out of the box.

You generally find something that's comfortable and available, and stick with that brand and size. For me, it's been New Balance 14 extra wide for the last 20 years or so (yes, I'm a dad, and old). This has been fine for sneakers, and I even got a pair of NB hikers that have been working pretty great for me.My family and I love the beach, and every time we find ourselves shopping at the beach, I instinctively check the flip flop rack for something in a 14. To this day, I've never seen anything on those racks above a 13. So I went to Amazon, found a nice looking pair of flip flops, and the largest size they had was a 14. Figuring I could return if it didn't fit, I pulled the trigger. When I got them, I couldn't even get my toes past the straps. There is no way they were bigger than a 12!So I continued shopping the Amazon, and lo and behold, these New Balance slides showed up in my search results. Thinking they've never steered me wrong in the past (and I could return them again if they didn't fit), I decided to buy these in 14 X-wide.Like a lot of people said, they definitely need some breaking in. I just wore them around the house with socks on (never with socks in public though) for a few days, and they feel amazing now. I generally don't leave reviews this quickly, because I like to see how they hold up after a few months, but so far, so good. They feel relatively sturdy, and given how quickly I destroy shoes (I'm a big, active guy), I'll be happy to get two summers out of these, and with what I've seen so far, I don't think they'll disappoint.",

(Not that it needs to be like a pillow; but I find thinner/harder insoles uncomfortable).I was going to return these shoes; but I purchased some insoles (around $20) that provide much more cushion. Perhaps a guy who weighs less would find these shoes comfortable as is, with a thinner/hard insole; but I did not.Now that I have the softer insoles instead of the hard/thin insole that came with this shoe; I find this shoe very comfortable.I also like the square/boxy toe box; which gives my toes plenty of room, rather than a more tapered shoe that narrows at the toes.These shoes cost much less than many of the running shoes available.

I've been buying this model of New Balance for many years since they fit me and work well for everyday walking and casual living.  There is good arch support, they're very comfortable If I could find another brand that worked so well, I wouldn't hesitate to try them.  So far this is the brand that works.  They are pricey though, but they work for me and last years!  I got them a 1/2 size larger than my previous ones because I feel I need the extra room.",

I have wide feet for a woman and I went a half size down from my true size because this shoe runs a little long. Other than that, going a half size down fits perfectly. They are not as firm and heavy as a shoe like the Nike Air Max, but they still provide a fair amount of stability and support. I definitely recommend this shoe for active people and I personally plan on buying another pair when this one gets old.",

        "review": "I love New Balance 990 shoes and have bought them for years.  For some reason, this year's women's 990v6 has shoe laces that are too small to tie.  I went to my local New Balance shoe store, they said that everyone was unhappy with this and that I should call NB customer service.  After half an hour on hold, New Balance Customer Service told me that they do not solve shoelace problems, and that the problem is all mine.  The shoes come with too-small laces in 2 different colors (how special is that!).  It is costing me an additional $15 to order replacement shoelaces on Amazon, while taking my best guess at the right size to order.  I asked NB Customer Service to at least document the fact that their product has a problem, and the agent seemed overwhelmed at the effort that this would require.  With a $199 price tag, something here should really be handled a lot better.  Any chance that someone up there will read this?Footnote:  I bought the extra shoe laces, and now I really hate these shoes.  There is a huge amount of shoelace showing (is this supposed to be decorative?), and I prefer a shoe which is less shoelace, and more shoe material.  New Balance seems to have considered this, by providing 2 pairs of shoe laces - one white and one navy.  Theoretically, the navy laces would be less visible.  Unfortunately, the shoe has a white piping around the lacing area, so the navy laces just look dumb.  Use the white laces, which will never stay white, and they cover 1/3 of the shoe's front.",

It combines a propulsive ride with surprising softness, making it perfect for long races like the marathon where comfort is as important as speed.The updated FuelCell foam and Energy Arc plate offer a smooth, rolling transition that doesn\u2019t feel overly aggressive or rigid. The shoe feels fast but forgiving, which is exactly what I want over 42K.The fit is performance-oriented but comfortable. The upper hugs the foot well, is breathable, and doesn\u2019t cause any hot spots even after 30+ km.One small note: the outsole grip is decent but not amazing on wet roads \u2014 just something to keep in mind. That said, for race day, this shoe is a serious contender and offers great durability for a super shoe.____Las SC Elite v4 son de lo mejor que he probado en zapatillas con placa de carbono. Tienen una pisada muy propulsiva pero con una suavidad sorprendente, lo cual las hace ideales para carreras largas como la marat\u00f3n, donde tambi\u00e9n importa la comodidad.La espuma FuelCell mejorada y la placa Energy Arc ofrecen una transici\u00f3n fluida y con buen impulso, sin ser demasiado r\u00edgida ni agresiva. Se sienten r\u00e1pidas, pero sin castigar las piernas, justo lo que busco para los 42K.El ajuste es ce\u00f1ido, pero muy c\u00f3modo.

        "review": "I have been wearing the 1540 and its predecessors for nearly 20 years. I have gone through at least 30 pairs. Before this one there was the 1122 and the 1121, both in various v versions. Once before, a new version was bad. The product got bad reviews and sales tanked. They then quickly fixed the problems and came out with a v2 version. This shoe series, along with Brooks \"The Beast\", are the 2 best shoes for people who may have planter fasciitis, use orthotics, are overweight and/or over pronate. It is built on the New Balance S2 last which produces a straight lasted shoe with extra room in the toe box. The extra room in the toe box is a big deal for people with diabetes, neuropathy, bunions, etc.I wear these shoes every day. I keep 3 pairs in service, wearing each pair every 3 days. This allows the foam in the soles to re-expand between wearings and keeps the foam soft and cushiony much longer. I put a new pair of shoes into service every 18 months, replacing the oldest pair with new ones.I could see immediately that the 1540v3 is a whole new design from the v2. I put on the shoes and wore them around the house all evening. I immediately noticed that the shoes do not have that wonderful, soft cushiony feel that I am accustomed too with a new pair of this series of shoes. The soles are much harder and have less cushioning. The main reason I replace these shoes is when they no longer have enough cushion in them. I can tell, because my feet will to hurt badly at the end of the day. So to start out with new shoes that already have hard soles is a non-starter for me.The second thing I noticed with the v3 is that I am feeling hard pressure points through the arch support area and also along the outside edges of the shoes. I think this is caused by the combination of my orthotic inserts and the harder soles of the shoes. The pressure points were bad enough to make my feet sore after wearing them around the house for a few hours. This is also a non-starter for me.The shoes also have completely re-designed outer soles and the shoes have a more solid feel when you plant your foot and walk forward. The shoes resist rolling to the inside or outside more than the v2s. I like this more solid feel, but time will tell whether this increases or decreases foot comfort.The length of this shoe is exactly the same as the v2 model. The toe box of the v3 has a little more room in it and feels less tight on the toes. The front of the v3 toe box now points inward a little unlike the v2 model which pointed straight ahead. This crowds the outside of the toes a little and could be a problem for people who have bunions. Bunions shift the toes towards the outside of the shoes and crowd the toes against the outside of the shoes. I do have small bunions, but with the wider toe box on the v3 model, I don't think it would be a problem for me. I think this change was made to make the shoes look more stylish, but could decrease comfort for some wearers.The shoes have more padding along the sides and rear of the ankles which makes them more comfortable in those areas.  I really like the new styling and colors of the gray and blue shoes. The uppers seem to be made of stronger, more durable materials that would resist staining.  These are all nice improvements. The main thing I have disliked about the previous models is that they seem to wear out to quickly for a shoe in this price range. The soles lose their cushioning and the outer soles seem to be made of a soft rubber that wears away too quickly, especially in the heels. Time will tell whether the v3's will last any longer.Because of the lack of cushioning in the soles, these shoes no longer work for me. I am going to try out a pair of the Brooks Addiction 14 which worked out pretty well for me when New Balance ruined the 1122 model some years ago. I  may also try out a New Balance 840v4 model. If others also find the soles too hard on the v3 model, we may be seeing a v4 coming out soon. In the mean time, I will be keeping my eye out for v2 shoes in my size and color.Update on July 2, 2021: I just saw an announcement that the 1540v4 shoes will be released in Oct. 2021. This, the V3 version, will start to show limited size availability and, shortly before the V4 is released, will be offered at big discounts. I hope the V4 goes back to a softer sole like the V2 version has. If so, I will likely start wearing them again. In other aspects, it is a very good shoe.",

I have chronic ankle ache issues on one foot and so I really have problems finding comfortable shoes but New Balance Fresh Foam 880 sneakers always provide great comfort and support.  They give me a bounce to my step and  I would recommend these sneakers highly.  *However be careful when sizing them.  They are women's shoes so go by women's sizes when buying them.",

And as far as hiking goes, these shoes not only have no support, but the sole has no traction whatsoever.I would recommend this shoe to anyone looking for a very comfortable walking shoe and/or casual everyday shoe.

I wanted something to try as a test, typically I just run in whatever shoes I have, but I've found that my feet hurt and often form blisters.These met my price criteria and had great reviews at the price point, often taking the \"budget\" spot on top-lists on various sites. I'm not disappointed. My feet don't hurt and I haven't had anymore blisters despite increasing the distance in which I run vs. walking. That said, they aren't perfect for my wide feet in particular. I have found that they don't have enough in the arch department. This could be specific to my foot shape, but I've found that while it is wide enough to be comfortable, along the center it doesn't have  a wide enough base and my foot tends to rock inward as it lands. This leads to at least one of my feet becoming fatigued as that interior muscle along my arch tenses to make up for the lack of support.  If you have wide feet with little to no arch, this could be an issue for you as well. You'll want to stick to even terrain to combat this and pay attention to how your stride is landing, my neighborhood doesn't offer much perfectly flat road, unfortunately.That said, they are cheap, they are light, they keep my feet feeling fresh after a workout, instead of feeling sore all over. No blisters, no rubbing, no noticeable wear so far. A great holdover shoe for beginners until they can graduate to more expensive contenders in the wide-footed running space.",

I didn't like how bulky some of them felt. And it was quite an ordeal, because where I live there are like 3 options for stores to buy shoes. So I was mostly buying online, trying on at home, and then sending back when they didn't work out. Finally, it dawned on me that I should search for the style of New Balance that I already had. Sure enough, this one came up. I was skeptical after placing the order, thinking surely this will be another fail. But no, they fit great just like the previous ones I had of this style. I typically wear a 10, but since they're for exercising, I went up to an 11, because you always want that extra room for your toes. They're light weight, very comfortable and exactly what I wanted.

I have a straight lasted, narrow foot; very neutral gait; normal arch and no structural or biomechanics abnormalities other than boney ankles. I bought these NB Hierro trail shoes in the low cut version and they turned out to be my favorite trail shoes ever! And they have great durability - after a year and a half of regular use, they\u2019re still going strong (I alternate several pairs of shoes at a time to extend their mileage), but I\u2019m soon ready to retire them to be yardwork shoes. So I wanted to try these with a slightly higher ankle to keep the dirt & debris out better. I was a bit nervous because my ankles are so boney, so high tops often dig in. But these don\u2019t! \ud83d\udc4fThese are truly waterproof and have a gusseted tongue. They\u2019re very comfortable, responsive and cushioned - every bit as responsive and cushioned as the low cut version. They\u2019re light weight and very grippy, but you can still feel the road/trail for agility. And I really love the colors! It\u2019s a very cold gray, almost blueish grey. The lavender with dark pink accent colors are beautiful. They aren\u2019t too dark to wear in the summer, and they\u2019re attractive without being too bold so they don\u2019t clash with most outfits. These aren\u2019t nearly as hot as my winter hiking boots that are actual hiking boots and not just high top trail shoes. It\u2019s so nice to have both!There\u2019s only two negatives, which the low cut ones don\u2019t have. The toe shield on these is just leather, not hardened for extra protection like the low cut version. And you do have to be careful about how you lace these because the tongue is just barely wide enough, and something can dig in if you don\u2019t get it just right. I rethreaded one hole on the left shoe from under to over, and it\u2019s much better.I still wear Nike Vomero\u2019s on the road, but these are my favorites for the trails! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70",

There were lots of puddles, mud, and lots of places to slip.Tested water resistance when I sank into a muddy puddle. My foot got wet, but dried quickly. The traction was good when we had to cross large puddles on wobbly fallen branches.My feet stayed cool throughout the whole hike! I was impressed, even when it was pretty hot and humid out.Overall, these shoes are everything I needed them to be; cool, comfortable, cute, and supportive of my ankles and feet.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Original:I\u2019ve been on quite the hunt for a shoe that offered good ankle support, that\u2019s breathable for the summer, and something at least semi-cute. In the world of hiking, cute is not in the manufacturer\u2019s vocabulary\u2026 at least nothing that is reasonably affordable. I\u2019m pleased that these check all those boxes.I ordered these in a half size larger and in wide since I read several reviews about these being tight all over. The half size and width make these very comfortable and allow me to add thick socks for wetter and colder seasons! So plus!Bought these for an upcoming camping trip where there will be light hiking, but being pregnant, I need breathable shoes for the humid Texas heat. Haven\u2019t had a chance to test them out yet, but will update me them after I get a chance to put them to the test.It\u2019s worth noting that the rim of the ankles are stiff and does need to be broken in.

        "review": "First off, I'm a shoe nerd. I admit it. Growing up my Dad would buy us only \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude40 cheapest shoes he could find. They were so bad that we'd wear them out in a couple of months and I should be honest, I am not hard on my shoes, either (my older brother was a different story). Didn't make a difference. My Dad would rather buy us a pair of new shoes for $20 every couple months rather than spend $35 on ONE pair that would last at least a year (if not more). As a result, when I finally got a job and could buy my own, I had quite a collection. A habit I continue to this day.With that in mind, within the last year I've purchased 2 other pairs of New Balance trail running shoes which were (at that time) the most comfortable pairs of shoes I had ever purchased. Since then I bought a pair of Brooks Ghost Max which replaced those as the most comfortable pair of shoes I had ever owned.The Fresh Foam X have now replaced (by a slim margin) my Brooks for sheer comfort. I don't really run, but I DO an awful lot of hiking and walking. So strict comfort is pretty important to me. These shoes are simply brilliant in how comfortable they are. The previously mentioned New Balance Trail runners were, for a lack of a better term, had almost too much cushion. I know, how can a shoe have TOO much cushion? Well, those do...at least for me. For instance, I would never wear them for weight training, especially doing the dead lift. The cushion is SO pronounced that I'd be worried they could pull me off balance a little too easily. But then again, they aren't designed for weight lifting, so just keep that in mind.The Foam X shoes are a perfect balance between great cushion and sheer comfort. It must be hard for companies to achieve that balance without going too far but Kudo's to NB for pulling it off. The soles aren't as durable as the trail runners perhaps, but oh man are they a joy to wear. Again, since I don't run I cannot speak to how stable they'd be at doing any long/short distance running but man am I happy with mine.Overall \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude40 most comfortable shoes I own (and I own a LOT). I am VERY satisfied with my purchase.",

They are so soft, yet responsive and my knees and back do not hurt after a 10k in them at race pace.The only problem I have with them is they are HOT.  On a hot summer day, your feet will sweat like crazy in them, so it is best to run when it's cool else you might end up with wet shoes haha.New Balance really hit it out of the park with these.  They are my favourite shoes next to Saucony Hurricanes (which were discontinued), and I feel that I may need to get more pairs in the future.Fit was true to size in length, but the wide (2E) is really wide and feels more like a 3E to myself and I am forced to use ankle lockdown to keep my feet from sloshing around during the first half of my run.",

I have narrow and flat feet and hoped that these shoes would keep me comfortable all day by fitting good and feeling good. There's a fairly wide toe box that gives my feet room to move around, but not too wide where I can lock in my feet comfortably. Stability is kind of an issue because the shoes are stacked high, but I'm just using them to walk at work. The arch support will hopefully keep my flat feet pain free throughout the day, time will tell. There's a lot of padding and weight with the shoes that are probably going to be a little warmer than most, and they're not very breathable. I can count on New Balance for their shoe quality and durability; they should last a long time. I was able to get these under 100 dollars in this color which is awesome! Navy blue is favorite color!

I have had special orthotics, worn a boot and seen several podiatrists who all wanted to do some sort of different surgery. I bought these shoes after seeing a you tube video about relieving pressure on your forefoot for runners. I thought maybe it would help me. It really has. My wound is the best it has been and seems to finally be closing.The shoes fit true to size. I got wide ones and they are very comfortable in the toe box.  They are extremely light weight. When the package arrived I wondered if it actually had shoe inside.There is a slight learning curve if you are not used to the way these shoes redistribute your weight. At first it feels like you\u2019re falling backwards a bit. That subsides quickly. And finally, I think they look great though my family was quick to call them \u201cDad\u201d shoes. Well I am a Dad, so maybe it\u2019s not that bad. I certainly don\u2019t think they look like the older stereotypical new balance that men would wear with tube socks and shorts.

Amazon replaced them. The second pair started coming apart after I wore them about 5 or 6 times. This was from daily, gentle use, not even long walks. The soles have a honeycomb design. This design is flawed as segments of the sole start coming loose & create \"flaps\" that make it impossible to walk in them.

Some complain about the narrow toe box but I find the toe box roomy compared to my other NB shoes.One BIG quibble - sizing. I bought my first NB shoes 10 years ago, size 10.5 D. Over the years, NB sizing has become smaller and smaller to the point where I'm ordering size 13. I take maybe size 10 in regular shoes. Extremely annoying.Size 13 is slightly loose but 12 is too tight.

        "review": "This is a great shoe!  Super comfortable daily shoes for me for the last few weeks, but there is a huge caveat: the toe boxes are low volume. The roof of the toe box is very close to the tops/knuckles of the toes. I tried my usual Saucony and NB  size, 10.5, in store and did not notice the claustrophobic toe box. I ordered 10.5 on Amazon and wore them in the house but never could feel comfortable and figured they would drive me nuts! I tried 10 wide (not extra wide) and that gave my digits more breathing room, solving my problem. I made a good choice going down a half size, as I believe 10.5 wide would have been too big.  The rest of the shoe does not seem to fit wide (admittedly I have not really worn wides before).Now that my toes can relax a bit I can appreciate the plush comfort of these babies. I like that the heel cups are not harsh or unforgiving, they are a little supple. I have been nursing both my Achilles tendons for a few weeks now\u2014breaking in Brooks Cascadia 16s on one hike nearly broke me!!I never notice the extended fins in back; I thought they might \u201ccatch\u201d going down carpeted stairs, but no issue.I am almost ready to get back in the mountains with these and really test them (and my heels) out. I will mos def buy more when I see a deal. Hierro V7 are my new favorites and I have tried numerous Adidas, Saucony, Merrill, North Face, and Scarpa trail runners and hikers the last few months. Robust, comfortable, and look rad.Edit:  I just did about an hour in the dry Boulder Flatirons at Chautauqua Park, and I love these shoes. The wides were barely big. I kept them fairly loose due to concerns with my Achilles and needing some extra give going uphill. Tightened them a bit just before descent, as usual, but didn\u2019t wanna fiddle with them again. Can easily, comfortably lock them down a bit more next time.Comfortable on trail, very soft, you do feel big rock points and ground features underfoot, but I did not mind. These Hierros do not feel tall to me\u2014great height/stack/drop that reminds me of my fave NB trail runners from 20 years ago. (I only wonder how they will hold up given how soft they are.)Edit: I now have three pairs of Hierros. Gotta say I would love some rock plate protection underneath as I have to be careful with foot placement on particularly pointy, sharp rocks (like 10% of the time on foothills trails). I occasionally trim down the hairy, wispy fibers that work their way out of the abrasion protection of the toe box. The shoes are all pretty easy to wipe down with a washcloth after a dusty hike.The Gore-Tex fit for me just like the regular V7.  I thought I\u2019d need to go up a half size like I often do for Gtx, but they were too big. Went back to 10 wide and they fit very well. You have to look at all the pix in the Amazon ad to see which are the Gtx (navy/black, crazy bright green!, and black/orange). I got the black with orange bottoms and have to say the orange is strangely close to pink\u2014not the \u201cclassic\u201d orange and black I expected. Not noticeable enough for me to exchange, though. They also have skinnier laces than the non-Gtx. The thicker laces work perfectly, but the skinny ones are a little finicky and knot up on me sometimes.  GREAT shoes.",

Overall sole cushioning is good without being mushy. But the best feature is the Vibram sole. It adds desirable overall stiffness (less toe lift), added width gives lateral support, and lessens feeling sharp objects beneath. The nicely lugged sole on smooth, interior surfaces feels secure, although produces some suction cup sounds at times. As other reviews have pointed out, the semi-hardened toe shields do produce unsightly \u201cfiber hairs\u201d over time.  I have trimmed them and they still come back.

It's gotten so bad in the past I couldn't get out of bed without support like crutches or a knee scooter. It's heartbreaking to me to say the least, as I really enjoy being active and outdoors, but am afraid of the smallest slip or pushing it too hard for the fear I will be out of commission for days, so these days I am very very stringent on what footwear I buy/wear. I bought these after a small slip caused a PF flareup on the disc golf course, which is very hilly and full of uneven ground and rocky terrain.From early on I could see that these were a perfect fit for me, the wide size actually accommodated my foot and didn't bulge out like Nikes or Adidas shoes of the same size. The cushion is just enough without being \"marshmallow-y\" to where I've rolled my ankles in other shoes. the grip and weight of the shoes are great to avoid slips when walking up/down hills and rocky terrain. I've walked to/from my local disc golf course and played multiple rounds of disc golf back to back (~10 miles and 5 hours on my feet) in one day with not even soreness in my feet! The night/day difference after buying these shoes still astounds me.These are my absolute go-to shoes anytime I'm doing some outside active activity, I've even started doing short hikes/trails with the confidence that I won't have pain the next day and can just focus on the most important thing, enjoying the outdoors.

I purchased the Hierro shoes at full price, and was not disappointed. I need a hip replacement, and I fall often. Every surface on this shoe sticks to the surface I am walking on. I fall less when wearing these shoes. The fit is as expected. I have a wide forefoot, so I buy shoes with a wide fit. New Balance is the only brand that works for my feet. The shoes are durable and stylish- I highly recommend them.",

        "review": "I\u2019m an ex semi-pro triathlete. I\u2019ve had a few injuries and I\u2019m not 29 any more, so I\u2019m very picky about my shoes. I used to only run on roads for speed but do trails now that I\u2019m retired from competing. This is my second pair of NB Hierro trail shoes. My first pair were v7 Gore-Tex, and they were the best trail shoes I ever had! They\u2019re very comfortable, have enough cushioning &  protection, but I can still feel the ground which I like because they\u2019re more agile. They\u2019re light enough, and they look nice. And I love the toe protect! It has saved my toenails more than once. And both the cushioning and tread last incredibly long - longer than Nike and much longer than Brooks. I like these better than the Nike Pegasus trails because I felt my heels slip in the new Pegasus trails and because these have the toe protect and they last much longer, although I still prefer Nike Pegasus and Nike Vomero on the road.I like to have a second pair of both road and trail shoes to alternate each, and I only need one pair of each with Gore-Tex for when it\u2019s wet because without GTX they\u2019re more breathable and a tiny bit lighter. These v8 have a different tread than the v7 that is more grippy; otherwise they feel identical.The only thing I don\u2019t like about these is that they\u2019re wider than the last model, why do not to be a dealbreaker. I actually double check the box to make sure they didn\u2019t send me the wrong width. I probably won\u2019t buy them again because of this.These arrived in a super beat up New Balance box with torn paper. Fortunately, I don\u2019t really care about that. They were sealed in a plastic bag and then in another box that was in perfect condition for shipping. The shoes themselves are fine, but I can tell they\u2019ve been tried on because the laces were twisted. Again, I don\u2019t really care because I got them on sale and they\u2019re otherwise brand new with the tags still on, but I thought I\u2019d mention it for people who might care.",

I was reluctant to buy a shoe with a fairly thick sole, but the shoes were recommended by physical therapists as being one of the best for people whose knees are sensitive to concrete floors.  The shoe is well-padded inside - the arch support is perfect, the heel cup keeps narrow heels in place.  The toebox is wide and gives your toes plenty of room to move in.  Also, important to me is the mesh covering over the toe box.  I had surgery on my right foot and can never find comfortable shoes.  These shoes fit the bill.  Best of all, walking on concrete and suffering the rebounding effect of sore knees is gone.  The inner sole feels ergonomically designed for the bottom of the feet, and there is deep cushioning with a bit of spring action.  This is a perfect shoe for me.  I bought a pair of white shoes but want to buy other colors, as well.",

When I went for my daily 3 mile walk, I realized what wasn't apparent during the time in the house with it: the toe box, even in a wide, was rather snug. It was wide enough, but shallow. Over the extended time of the walk, my second toe became sore. I'm normally a size 7, purchased a 7 1/2. If I were doing it over again, I'd get it a full size bigger. I own a NB 1080 size 7 1/2, and the toe box is roomier, so it's this particular model.",

The 840 has a wide toe box, I have to buy an extra wide.  I wore my first pair of 840s for almost 2 years. I exercised or walked 5-6 days per week and never had any problems. A couple months ago I bought the 880 in an extra wide, thought they were wide enough, within ~6 weeks my feet were hurting, my plantar fasciitis flared up, even had to go to the doctor.  Besides following the doctors orders I ordered a new pair of 840s. My feet are back to normal. The 880 is a nice shoe other than a narrower toe box the shoe is comfortable and supportive. I will wear them on days I don\u2019t have to do a lot of walking. If you need a wide toe box go with the 840.",

The boot arrived in one day, about 4 hours before a snow storm, so I got to try them out quickly on my 5 mile walk this morning. My area plows their paths so I walked mostly on blacktop with a thin layer of snow/ice. These shoes have amazing grip on slippery surfaces and even in places where I walked through 4 inches of snow the grip was very good. The boots are fairly light weight and I love the fresh foam comfort. They fit well and are waterproof at least in snow. Perfect for my needs. I have a custom insole and it fit nicely inside. The boot with the original inserts does not have much arch support which surprised me.",

I have goretex outer wear that is impervious to water so it is hard to understand why these were not the same. I did not even test them in rain, standing water, puddles, creeks or streams; only in 4-6 in long grass after a steady rain. Water only seeped in slightly at the toe but if more water, rain or foliage was present it would be worse. On a positive note the shoes are very comfortable. The laces require double tying - irritating. The eyelets in the shoe are not reinforced so the hole is deforming. Other lace \u201ccleats\u201d are a fabric that may be coming loose at the stitching. The top 2 cleats are metal & are fine. There is a \u201clip\u201d at the bottom rear heal that almost looks like mold forming excess that should have been trimmed. It may serve as a toe pry point to ease remove of shoe. However it collects dirt & sometimes catches on brush. Hope this aids your decision tree.",

        "review": "I recently bought the Women's 510 Running Shoe from New Balance, and I couldn't be more pleased with my choice. During my runs, these shoes have provided me with more support and comfort than I had anticipated.The midsole's cushioning is excellent, delivering a responsive feel that deflects impact without being overly soft. My knees have occasionally been sore, but ever since I started wearing these shoes, I've noticed a noticeable change in how they feel after my runs.Even on slippery or uneven conditions, the outsole maintains outstanding traction. With every step, I feel secure and solid, which frees me from anxiety about slipping or sliding and lets me concentrate on my run.These sneakers' breathability is just another fantastic quality. Even during extended runs or in warm weather, the upper mesh material keeps my feet cool and dry. No more uncomfortable and hot feet!In terms of sizing, I discovered that these shoes fit true to size and offer a secure and supportive fit without being oppressive. The design is fashionable and I value the range of color choices that let me select a pair that goes with my running gear.",

I bought these in a wide size and they are wide enough for me to spread my toes.  If you like a really soft squishy shoe with a lot of arch support, these are great.  For me they were too squishy and archy and it made my feet work harder to walk in, which was bothersome.  The good part is the insoles can be removed.  Once I removed the insoles they were much more comfortable for me.",

This is the second time I have had the exact same problem with these shoes.1.5 months ago, I ordered a similar style shoe only to find that they squeaked.  I did not end up returning them because I felt it would be a hassle.  So I ordered a second pair, this pair.Within a week, they are squeaking as well.  I understand the need to keep costs down, but they are compromising in the wrong areas.  New Balance has now lost a costumer.",

        "review": "I like these shoes very much, except for the insoles.  They fit me like I expected.  I need wide, and New Balance is one of the few brands with wide sizes that actually feel wide.  I have an average arch, and this shoe has the right amount of arch for me.  The shoes are well made and have a nice tread.  I have worn these hiking and camping several times and wear them often for just normal wear.  The shoes are not advertised as waterproof but do seem to be water repellent.  I have not submerged them in water but have worn them in damp conditions, and my feet remained dry.Now for the negative, the insoles.  The insoles are textured. The original packaging indicated the insoles were massaging.  I found the texture mildly annoying from the beginning but livable.  After only 4 months, the insoles became very annoying.  I could feel the texture a lot.  The insoles seemed to become hard.  My feet began to hurt quite a lot.  I was disappointed that I might have to discontinue using the shoes.  I took the simple, flat, thin foam insoles out of another pair of shoes to try in them, and the pain and discomfort immediately stopped.  I'm going to buy a cheap pair of thin foam cushion insoles for this pair of shoes, so I can continue to use them.  The shoes look almost new and show very little wear on the tread. Another problem with the insoles was that they squeaked with every step.  That is no longer a problem with the original insoles removed.",

I can afford New Balance, I thought. I still spent $90 on these shoes titled Fresh Foam. I expected softness, foamy, cloud like comfort when i put my foot inside . I got none of that.  In fact, the shoe felt hard as a rock in the bottom. I guess the fresh foam refers to the bottom that you stand on. The phrase fresh reminds me of the 80's just like this scribble, paint design on the bottom of the shoe. I must've missed that in the picture. I found it ugly and immediately colored over that with a black market. So now I have spent almost $100 on shoes that I find to be rather uncomfortable and ugly. I've given it a couple weeks now and I can say these things: the toe protect is just a waterproof barrier but keeps toes from getting wet in puddles.  These do NOT qualify as slip resistant and will in fact send you skating . The main body of the shoe is net which I didn't notice when ordering. Not the warmest shoes for winter. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone and I wouldn't buy them again either.  I'm still on the hunt for some good shoes that make my feet happy. This foam isn't fresh enough for me.",

These shoes have exceeded my expectations.First and foremost, the comfort level is off the charts. From the moment I put them on, it felt like I was walking on clouds. What's even more impressive is that there was absolutely no break-in period required. I wore them straight out of the box, and my feet were great from the get-go.One of the standout features for me is how incredibly lightweight they are. It feels like I'm hardly wearing shoes at all. This makes them perfect not only for running but also for everyday wear. Whether I'm hitting the pavement or just going about my daily activities, these shoes provide the support and comfort I need.Another huge plus is how breezy and cool they keep my feet, even during warm weather. The ventilation in these shoes is top-notch, and it really helps in preventing that uncomfortable sweaty feeling. My feet stay cool and fresh throughout the day.And let's not forget about style. These shoes are not only functional but also incredibly stylish. I've received compliments on their sleek design, and they easily pair with both athletic wear and casual outfits. They're versatile enough to suit any occasion.In conclusion, the New Balance Men's Fresh Foam Roav V1 Running Shoes are a winner in my book. They check all the boxes for comfort, style, and ease of wear. If you're looking for a pair of running shoes that deliver on every front, look no further.

Instant comfort - spectacular! Those shoes happily breathe so they're great through the summer, but understandably not wind resistant or waterproof. Then I discovered this shoe (Garoe - another strange name) on amazon. It is truly spectacular. It does everything I'd want a shoe to do. For living in these casual days this shoe, in black with its cool blue details can almost serve as your everything-but-a-wedding shoe. Unless it was a casual wedding! I've run in them, ridden my bike, walked miles. I am most happy. Maybe the best shoe ever, for me. Do make sure you purchase the GORE TEX model. It has a label on its side and the price is a wee bit higher than the non-Gore Tex version. Worth it.",

The boot arrived in one day, about 4 hours before a snow storm, so I got to try them out quickly on my 5 mile walk this morning. My area plows their paths so I walked mostly on blacktop with a thin layer of snow/ice. These shoes have amazing grip on slippery surfaces and even in places where I walked through 4 inches of snow the grip was very good. The boots are fairly light weight and I love the fresh foam comfort. They fit well and are waterproof at least in snow. Perfect for my needs. I have a custom insole and it fit nicely inside.

I have goretex outer wear that is impervious to water so it is hard to understand why these were not the same. I did not even test them in rain, standing water, puddles, creeks or streams; only in 4-6 in long grass after a steady rain. Water only seeped in slightly at the toe but if more water, rain or foliage was present it would be worse. On a positive note the shoes are very comfortable. The laces require double tying - irritating. The eyelets in the shoe are not reinforced so the hole is deforming. Other lace \u201ccleats\u201d are a fabric that may be coming loose at the stitching. The top 2 cleats are metal & are fine. There is a \u201clip\u201d at the bottom rear heal that almost looks like mold forming excess that should have been trimmed. It may serve as a toe pry point to ease remove of shoe. However it collects dirt & sometimes catches on brush. Hope this aids your decision tree.",

They provide good stability, although I also purchased the Mizuno Wave Horizon as my second shoe in the rotation, and that shoe is much more stable.

The traction on these is great! They feel lightweight. They keep your foot warm and dry which is exactly what I needed. These are harder- They aren\u2019t as soft as my New Balance Fuel Cell trainers or even my Pegasus but you can\u2019t expect all of that with these being gortex and trail shoes! They are still comfortable! I typically am a solid 8.5 and I did purchase a 9 and honestly could have sized up to a 9.5- My toe is almost right at the top. I put insoles in for added comfort but they pushed my toe so to the top they didn\u2019t work. I typically run 4-5 days a week 3 miles or more and these will definitely do the trick! Keeping my feet dry when running through the slush or rain this winter was exactly what I wanted. I really love this shoe- They are a great buy and so cute on!",

        "review": "I walk all year long and when it's wet/snowy I need something to keep my feet dry. So far I haven't had these out in a heavy rain, but they are waterproof. With that said, they don't seem to breathe very much, and my feet are a little warm/sweaty, but that can be mitigated with the right socks (moisture-wicking). As other reviewers stated, the toe box is a little tighter than you may be used to. My toe is sitting in the normal spot, but the vertical height inside the toe box is a little less than with a different style sneaker. This doesn't bother me, and after about 2 minutes, I don't even notice it. I feel like there was a short \"break in\" period needed, mainly for the area around the ankle. But that may just be the shape of my foot/ankle? After the first walk in them (~1 mile), they were fine, and I haven't had any issues since. I was originally thinking I'd need an insert to raise up my heel but I've decided I don't need that. I like the color too - not too flashy and not white (to show dirt). They provide ample support for walking, and I would buy them again. I have a high arch and high instep, and the middle of the shoe fits great, very comfortable (I've had issues with this in the past with certain New Balance styles). If you have a wider foot, this may not be comfortable for you though, given the more \"sandwiched\" toe box feel of the shoe.  I'm looking forward to some puddle jumping to really test them!",

I'm a dog walker and can walk in these for a couple hours a day without my feet hurting. they get a bit hot due to the waterproofing though so I wouldn't want to wear them all day.",

        "review": "My son used to wear vans for the first 3.5 years of his life. But we noticed he walked pigeon toed. After a visit to an orthopedic, he was diagnosed with flat feet, an as result, it was affecting his gait- hence the pigeon toed. He recommended New Balance sneakers, as well as gait plates to correct his walk. These were the first pair I ordered and I am truly happy. The design is really nice- sleek, modern and goes with any type of bottoms. I especially like that the actual inserts are removable and I can stick his plates in there without a problem. He says they are extremely comfortable, even with the plates and the plates themselves are hard plastic. I try to buy them in every color. These do run a little small, so maybe buy a half size up. However, if your kid needs to use inserts, try to buy just the right size to avoid discomfort. These sneakers hold up very well. He wears them everywhere and almost all the time. We have been hiking, to parks and long walks and they still look pretty good. They wash really well too! I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to find something close to this sneaker.",

During my runs, these shoes have provided me with more support and comfort than I had anticipated.The midsole's cushioning is excellent, delivering a responsive feel that deflects impact without being overly soft. My knees have occasionally been sore, but ever since I started wearing these shoes, I've noticed a noticeable change in how they feel after my runs.Even on slippery or uneven conditions, the outsole maintains outstanding traction. With every step, I feel secure and solid, which frees me from anxiety about slipping or sliding and lets me concentrate on my run.These sneakers' breathability is just another fantastic quality. Even during extended runs or in warm weather, the upper mesh material keeps my feet cool and dry. No more uncomfortable and hot feet!In terms of sizing, I discovered that these shoes fit true to size and offer a secure and supportive fit without being oppressive.

I have an average arch, and this shoe has the right amount of arch for me.  The shoes are well made and have a nice tread.  I have worn these hiking and camping several times and wear them often for just normal wear.  The shoes are not advertised as waterproof but do seem to be water repellent.  I have not submerged them in water but have worn them in damp conditions, and my feet remained dry.Now for the negative, the insoles.  The insoles are textured. The original packaging indicated the insoles were massaging.  I found the texture mildly annoying from the beginning but livable.  After only 4 months, the insoles became very annoying.  I could feel the texture a lot.  The insoles seemed to become hard.  My feet began to hurt quite a lot.  I was disappointed that I might have to discontinue using the shoes.  I took the simple, flat, thin foam insoles out of another pair of shoes to try in them, and the pain and discomfort immediately stopped.  I'm going to buy a cheap pair of thin foam cushion insoles for this pair of shoes, so I can continue to use them.  The shoes look almost new and show very little wear on the tread. Another problem with the insoles was that they squeaked with every step.  That is no longer a problem with the original insoles removed.",

        "review": "Just got these midcut trail runners and been walking around the house for awhile.Initially I hesitated to buy because I sometimes have issues with the mid-ankle height. They tend to bother my ankle bone... but not these New Balance. They are comfortable and do not rub or chafe the bone.My other issue was the chunky squared heel/sole. I thought it was going to be obtrusive.  After putting them on and checking them out I think they are rather complimentary and do not stick out at all.The materials used in these hikers are very good.  I sprayed water on the toe area and it beaded and ran right off, so they are waterproof as listed. Gore-tex rocks!! No one likes wet soggy feet while running and hiking around the country!!Arguably the best feature on this shoe is the locking lace hooks. The final top two lace hooks lock the lace in when you snap it in... great feature because you don't have to hold tension when tying the laces!!! My Merrell hiking boots do not have this feature and I am forever trying to hold them tension at the correct point while tying them. It's rather frustrating because it's hard to get them right... they either get tied too loose or too tight. Not so with these. Once you set the correct tension you simply lock the lace it and it gets held right there so you can tie the shoe with ease.I wear an 8.5 M... in every shoe I have ever bought,  so I bought an 8.5 M and in length they fit perfect. My foot is by no means wide but wearing mid-weight socks these kinda hug my foot and the toe box feels a bit restrictive. I much prefer a wider toe box to prevent toe issues and foot fatigue. So my only real complaint is that this may be an issue on long walks, runs or hikes. Also due to the materials used making these, I rather doubt they will stretch any.Overall, I am glad I decided to give these NB a try... they are more comfortable than my Salomon Speedcross 4s which for me are far too stiff in the soles and tire my feet out.I will keep this pair...",

The padding around the ankle helps stabilize my ankles while not being so thick and stiff as to be uncomfortable. I will say that some comments made mention of the shoe running slightly small. I think it's the width. I purchased my normal size 8 but got the wide version and it's perfect. I can wear thick socks if needed but don't feel like it's squeezing my toes. For me these are working out great and I would recommend them.",

        "review": "- Sandals are cushiony, sinking in just a little to a solid-ish bed but without feeling too pillow soft or mushy. Have Fresh Foam shoes and can confirm the feel is similar.- Textured footbed provides grip for soles of feet so the sandal doesn't slip around. Also provides a slight relaxing massage feel.- Look is slightly bulky but overall pretty stylish, making more of a fashion statement that an IDGAF flip flop or velcro sandal.- Fit is a hit or miss. Width wise, this sandal fits both narrow and wide (2E) feet. However, the height of the upper (clearance from the footbed to the strap) does not correctly fit the proper foot size. Feet two (2) sizes smaller than the stated size cannot fully slide into it because of how restrictively low the upper is. The strap stretches somewhat, but after a few weeks of use it has not \"stretched out\" and always gives a too-tight-on-top-of-foot feel as if you were wearing a shoe one size too small and pulled the laces unreasonably tight.If you can dig the look and have not-tall feet (sole to top of foot), this recovery slipper will serve you well. For those of us with normal height feet, look elsewhere unless you like an extra snug feel - three stars ***",

These have held up and looked nicer than the Adidas and Under Armor shoes I bought in August that both already have holes in them.  NB seems to hold up the best to a very very active 8 year old.I love how it cranks closed.  So much so I wish they had the same mechanism on adult shoes for me!  It has held up well to daily use on the last 2 pairs, I really figured the string would break but didn\u2019t.  My son loves it and open and closes just to crank them down for fun so it really was tested a LOT so I give that a 10/10 on durability.I give the shoe 10/10 for durability overall as well!  I will continue getting these as they are the best bang for the buck.  The last pair I bought had lasted a year.  It does look worn but no holes and still works well.  His feet just grew out of them.",

As someone with wide feet, I\u2019ve struggled for years to find running shoes that truly fit. I normally wear a women\u2019s size 6 in length, but even in size 7.5 wide versions of many brands (including the highly recommended ASICS GT-2000 and Mizuno Inspire), my toes still felt cramped.Then I discovered that I could try wide-width boys\u2019 shoes instead \u2014 and I regret not trying this sooner! The toe box in the New Balance 860 boys\u2019 size 6 wide version gives me plenty of room for my toes to move comfortably, while still offering secure support around the entire foot. Breathability is excellent \u2014 even when walking outdoors in 90\u00b0F heat, I can feel airflow inside the shoe, which helps keep my feet cool and comfortable.The cushioning and support are great both for running and for long walks \u2014 my feet feel well-supported without any pressure points or stiffness. I highly recommend this option for other wide-footed runners \u2014 don\u2019t overlook the possibility of trying boys\u2019 sizes. I will definitely be buying these again!Bonus: the boys\u2019 version costs less than women\u2019s!",

So if you\u2019re like me trying to figure out your kid\u2019s shoe size when they suddenly jump 2 sizes overnight, try the wide!",

It's not a dealbreaker, but definitely something to keep in mind if you're aiming for a deeper navy look.Sizing is also solid.

My normal size, and the regular wide is wide enough.Plus, they have a versatile & flattering silhouette that goes with any pants, from sweats to jeans, and a colorway selection to fit all tastes.

She said incredibly impressed with both the design and functionality. These sneakers are a great blend of comfort, style, and practicality perfect for active during Gym class.#Pros:1. BOA Closure System\u2013 The standout feature of these sneakers is the BOA system, which makes putting them on and taking them off super easy. No more struggling with laces or velcro\u2014just a quick twist and the shoes are snug and secure. My child loves how fast they can get ready, and I appreciate how it makes it hassle-free to get the right fit every time.2. Comfortable and Supportive \u2013 The sneakers provide great cushioning and support, which is key for growing feet. The lightweight design doesn\u2019t weigh down my child, and the padded collar and tongue add an extra layer of comfort. After wearing them all day, there are no complaints about sore feet.3. Durable and Well-Made \u2013 New Balance is known for making durable shoes, and these are no exception. The material feels sturdy, and the rubber sole offers excellent traction, so my child can run, jump, and play without slipping or causing wear and tear on the shoes.4. Stylish Design \u2013 The all-white color with subtle New Balance branding gives these sneakers a clean, modern look. They pair easily with any outfit\u2014whether it\u2019s for sports, school, or casual wear. My child loves how trendy they look, and I love how versatile they are.5. Breathability \u2013 The upper material is breathable, helping to keep feet cool and dry during active play. I\u2019ve noticed that these sneakers don\u2019t trap moisture or cause any discomfort, which is a huge plus for all-day wear at school.#Cons:1. White Can Get Dirty Quickly \u2013 While the all-white design looks sleek, it does tend to get dirty quickly, especially in active kids. Regular cleaning is a must to keep them looking fresh.2. Price\u2013 Like most New Balance shoes, these sneakers are on the pricier side, but I do think the quality, comfort, and convenience justify the cost.===The New Balance Kids White Comfy BOA-Type Sneakers have been a fantastic choice for my girl. With the easy-to-use BOA system, comfortable fit, and durable construction, they\u2019ve become a go-to pair for everyday wear. If you\u2019re looking for a high-quality, stylish, and functional sneaker that will keep up with active kids, I highly recommend these!",

I picked them up recently and they\u2019ve quickly become a staple in my wardrobe.Style:These have that vintage court shoe vibe with a clean, minimalist look that works well with a lot of outfits. Whether you\u2019re into sporty streetwear or just want a low-key sneaker with subtle retro flair, the 480 V1 delivers. The \u201cN\u201d branding is bold without being flashy, and the overall silhouette is timeless.Comfort:For a sneaker based on a basketball silhouette, the comfort is impressive. The Ortholite insole gives you good support, and the padding around the ankle adds extra comfort. They\u2019re great for all-day wear\u2014walking around, running errands, or casual hangouts.Fit:They fit true to size for me. The toe box isn\u2019t overly narrow, which is nice if you like a bit of room, and the laces allow for a secure fit. The leather upper is a bit stiff out of the box, but it softens up nicely with wear.Quality:The materials feel solid\u2014especially for the price point. The leather upper feels durable, and the sole has good grip and traction. I\u2019ve worn mine in a few different conditions, and they\u2019ve held up really well.Final Verdict:If you\u2019re looking for an everyday sneaker with heritage appeal, solid comfort, and clean styling, the New Balance 480 V1 is a great option.

Nice wide grippy sole for stability with Minimus zero drop profile. Although, I'll admit that adding a lightweight padded insole would make these supreme. I love NB Minimus shoes and was disappointed when NB got rid of their Minimus running line...My only complaints are the neoprene tongue because it slides a bit and the size issue which hints at lower production QA standards for New Balance. Regardless, it's a great lightweight zero drop shoe, especially if you can get them on sale. Easily 4 stars, 5 if my regular size fit out of the box.Pro-Tip: run the laces over themselves at the last loops for DIY lace lock. See pic.",

So, I immediately purchased these, in the same size as my current pair (11 Wide).  However, I cannot wear these for more than a few minutes before my feet start to hurt, and I can't lace them loosely enough to prevent them from making my feet feel choked.  When I was running ultra marathons, the Minimus Road and Minimus Trail were my go to shoes.  Those were also size 11 Wide and the fit and comfort were also amazing.  In my opinion, the changes made in the Minimus Trainer v2 are a disaster for anyone with wide feet.  If you have wide feet, my suggestion is to look elsewhere for your training shoes.",

        "review": "So, the way I got turned on to these shoes was through a friend. She is an older working woman, (I am a young working woman), and she gave me a pair of these that she had worn through and let me tell you man, those were genuinely the most comfortable pair of shoes I\u2019ve ever worn. My feet are wide and the shoes were not, so due to them being so comfortable, I was then forced to buy a new pair and they are just wonderful. I genuinely couldn\u2019t recommend these enough. They offer great arch and ankle support, they\u2019re ridiculously comfortable, and they\u2019re really cute chunky white dad shoes. My one note is that they run a little narrow, so if you have a wider foot you may want to buy a wide pair in your size rather than just going up a size. Seriously tho,  I never write reviews, but these shoes are so good I had to. Highly recommend them especially for older people, (but I also love them as a 26 yr old). The shoe size I purchase was an 8 1/2 wide and they fit perfectly. These shoes are so good that when they eventually are ran through, I\u2019m planning on just buying another identical pair. I\u2019m almost certain these are the only pair of tennis shoes I\u2019m going to wear for years to come.",

The \"tongue\" of the shoe is a bit sturdy and hurts the upper area of my foot, and the support on the bottom feels a bit flat. Maybe I'm just too picky, idk. I bought this because a friend has it and it looks suuper cute. She's on her 2nd pair and absolutely loves it--says it fits her perfectly and that it is super comfortable!I guess it might just be my feet's format that's weird.In either case, it's a good quality shoe! The material is great, very sturdy and padded!",

It keeps your feet dry and snug without being tight and easy to take on and off without having to readjust or tie shoelaces throughout the day. Not a pretty or ugly pair of shoes. Which is great. Super slip resistant and last me an average of 8 months. I have flat feet so I do add an insert, but these are still much more comfortable in comparison to alot of slip proof work shoes.",

I know what it takes to push the limits and now that I am playing in a very competitive adult baseball league, I know that: comfort, light weight and stability are valued benefits from a training shoe.I play Adult BB as a catcher and these trainers have added protection at the front of the toe without sacrificing mobility or comfort. The light weight foam allow me to wear these shoes just about everywhere, and the grip nubs are perfectly sized for everyday wear. The grip/traction is amazing on every surface, not just turf! Grass, dirt, concrete, slab cement, aluminum, etc\u2026 have all been tested and I have excellent traction.I removed the stock laces and replaced them with bungee laces (this allows more even top-foot pressure across the foot - something I learned from years as a marathoner and triathlete).Highly recommend these trainers for anyone serious about their training or that just appreciate a comfortable and capable athletic shoe.I usually purchase size 10 for all of my shoes, and these are no different. Just order your normal size and your will be good to go.I have normal width feet but I\u2019m more flat footed than most people I know. The toe box fits comfortably secure and does not move around, while the heel are stays put like it should. What little \u201carch\u201d I do have does feel supported, which contributes to the overall comfort.Highly recommend!",

Only time will tell if they hold up I\u2019m really hard on shoes. I will give an update at 6 months. And when I finally destroy the shoe.Iv been wearing the shoes 6 months now there holding up and especially cleaned. Because there waterproof they keep my feet dry from outside water and snow they work great for grip on snow ice water oil vinegar, milk, whatever spilled in the truck. They do make my feet sweet and there are starting to smell like a nasty gym locker room. I have to leave them in another room or in a bag. The backs by the Hill are starting to wear holes from slipping my foot in and out. And the material between the steel toe and my toes is wearing thin and feeling a bit uncomfortable.
