        "review": "I've been wearing the Reebok Energen Lux shoes for over a month, and I'm genuinely impressed by their performance as an all-day, every-day shoe. I needed something that could handle both short gym sessions and constant wear\u2014from morning errands to evening walks\u2014and these have quickly become my go-to pair.What truly stands out is the enduring support. Many comfortable shoes feel great on day one but start to flatten out after a couple of weeks. These Energen Lux shoes have successfully retained their cushion and responsiveness, even with continuous daily use. The mid-sole provides a fantastic blend of softness for comfort and firmness for stability, which is essential for keeping feet and joints happy when you're on your feet for hours.The fit is true to size, and the upper mesh material is breathable without feeling flimsy. The construction is solid, showing no premature signs of wear on the sole or the upper fabric, which speaks volumes about their quality at this price point.If you are looking for a highly versatile, comfortable, and reliable sneaker that can transition effortlessly from a light workout shoe to a shoe you wear daily without losing its supportive feel, I highly recommend the Reebok Energen Lux. Fantastic value and performance.",

BUT! They compromised on the uppers with making them under padded and somewhat stiff around the ankle and tongue.I would like to add that they run narrow in the midfoot but have ample room in the toe box. I have purchased wide shoes in brands like HOKA but these seem to run wide. Also, the cushioning is responsive and give good push off unlike the foam in shoes like the HOKA Clifton (which for me felt like running on a marshmallow).Overall, solid shoe 20 miles in and hope to get a couple Hundy out them.",

The entire upper is soft and tight, even the tongue, which makes it a great shoe for gym and sports. It is very light (by weight) compared to other sneakers.

        "review": "I love these tennis shoes. I was introduced to Brooks tennis shoes years ago, when I worked in the medical field; I fell in LOVE with my brooks, but certainly not the price tag. I saw these advertised on Amazon when searching for a new pair of tennis shoes, and as an avid purple lover, I just had to have these! I love the color; they\u2019re not too bright and not too dark, which means I can wear these with practically anything. I ordered these in a 6.5, since I typically wear a size 6.5-7. I will admit that they were a little tighter on the top. I\u2019m also 8 months pregnant, so I assumed it was from water retention, because they fit perfectly on other days. Although they don\u2019t fit like my Brooks, they\u2019re still very comfortable! Since I\u2019m in the final stages of my pregnancy, I still try to workout as much as I can; so far, they\u2019ve held up pretty well! Which, for $70, they should last awhile! They\u2019re very comfortable, durable, and lightweight, which are all very important to me when considering a shoe, especially since I practically live in them. I\u2019ve had them for a few months now, and although I haven\u2019t worn them enough to break them in, I have worn them enough times to give this honest review! They haven\u2019t left any blisters, and my feet didn\u2019t hurt while I adjusted to them. Overall, I\u2019d rate these tennis shoes a 4/5 for comfort, support, and functionality.",

Result is a more stable shoe with excellent ground contact. Not anchors or lifted like a lifting shoe and excellent side grip which gives it good lateral movement as well.Overall a stylish unicorn of a shoe that meets several needs of both weightlifting and aerobic activity.Obviously this all has trade-offs. Less toe spring and wider box means not as good of a running shoe as some others. Less heel and more flexible lateral movement means not a perfect squat shoe, but this is my pick for a weight lifter focused cross trainer that wants to fit in some cardio and calisthenics in the same workout without changing shoes.",

I\u2019m not sure how they will feel once I do a long distance walk on pavement for two miles. I\u2019m not a fan of the slits in the sole design, it has a thin layer is the bottom material, which makes me feel like it could peel easily. I guess time will tell (photo added ) . My experience with extra cushion shoes like these is they don\u2019t hold up for long term wear, usually about three months you can feel how they no longer have that bounce and feel different, almost like they go flat. This will result in knee foot and back pain. Yes I purchased them because of the cushion but only because I have been experiencing knee pain, and I have been walking more. I will add a review later after I have walked in them.",

You get a serious energy return running with it. The sizing here is for women (you'll have to add 1.5 size for men's size, in my case I'm 10.5, so I picked 12). There is a lot of ventilation and its night reflective too (see photos). This is a like a professional shoe for walking/running, just like a soccer or basketball shoe. Highly recommended.",

        "review": "I bought these sneakers to replace a sub-$30.00 pair of Kirkland sneakers that I got at Costco five or six years ago.  That's a long time for a walking sneaker, but those things refused to die.  They were some of the best money that I ever spent on footwear.  They've been pretty much indestructible, and they had the most comfortable insoles that I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  I've replaced the insoles a couple of times, but now the sneakers are looking long in the tooth.  Time for a new pair.  Unfortunately, it seems they don't make those particular sneakers anymore.  If they do, I can't find them.After looking over Amazon, I found these.  I'm not interested in any \"fashion forward\" screwball looking sneakers.  I just want I nice regular pair of sneakers at a reasonable price.  I've had pretty good luck buying sneakers online.  I order a size twelve and they fit without issue.  I was a little surprised when I first tried these sneakers on and they felt a little snug.  I like a snug sneaker, but these almost felt undersized.  I'm strictly talking about the width here.  Length wise they're fine.  I've been wearing them for over a week now, and they are definitely starting to break in.  They do feel like they run a little on the snug side, so if you like your sneakers roomy, you may want to consider going up half a size.Pros:- These were listed at $48.00 when I ordered them.  That's a good deal.  Assuming they hold up.- They feel well made and appear to be good quality.  (I'll revisit this after I've had them for awhile.)- They look good.  Of course, this is a matter of taste, but I think they look really nice.Cons:- They're a little on the snug side.  Okay by me, you might feel differently.- Short tongue.  Should be 1/2\" to 1\" longer.How they feel on your feet is a matter of taste.  These are getting more comfortable as I where them.  That's a good thing.  I like a snug fit, because I feel that it gives me more support.  You may feel otherwise.  I wish the soles were a little wider for more lateral stability.  This is a matter of individual preference.  The insoles are the soft and spongy type.  They provide comfort, but not much support.  I like them, but I don't think they'll last very long.  Overall, I'm happy with these so far.  If they hold up, I'll probably come back and up the rating to five stars.",

        "review": "I've been ordering the same shoes (with some slight model variations) for work from the same manufacturer for years. I'll usually wear them until the seams come apart or the tread wears out. The tread seemed to wear out pretty fast with the last couple pairs I bought, so I thought I'd try these instead.Got them yesterday and put them on today. Nice looking shoe. I'm worried about glue breaking down and the seam eventually  coming apart around the toe, but I guess that may or may not happen- will update. I usually order a wide shoe but that wasn't avail for this shoe, so they fit kind of snug. Not too snug though- definitely workable and I'm sure they'll loosen up as I break them in. Lots of cushioning. In fact, they're almost bouncy.Only issue out of the box is they are incredibly noisy. They squeak and creek with every movement. On both hard and soft surfaces, as well as wet and dry surfaces.  Mostly from the arch and heel area. And it's LOUD. I can't remember ever having shoes this noisy. I really hope they get less noisy as I wear them.UPDATE: So over 3 weeks later, the left shoe has quieted down a lot. It's still a little noisy though. The right shoe has shown no change. It sounds like a duck with each step I take, and it's quite loud. Inside, outside, wet, dry, hard surface or soft, this shoe is LOUD.  It's the rubber tread/sole on the bottom of the shoe that makes the noise. I'm almost 60 and I've never had shoes with this type of issue before. I'm very disappointed that a major brand like Reebok uses such crappy materials in their product. I WILL NOT be purchasing from Reebok again.UPDATE 2: So here it is 2 months later, and the right shoe is still loud as heck. It's the tread and the way it moves when I walk. It like rubs up against itself somewhere and makes that squeaking sound. I wear the shoes to work 6 days/week so you'd think it would have stopped by now. The other day it was raining and these shoes got soaked. They were too wet to wear the next day so I wore my back-ups, which are my previous pair by another brand. I was immediately reminded how nice it was to walk without loud noises coming from my shoes. That's it. I'm throwing these away and ordering a pair of my regular brand. will not buy these again.",

I wanted enough toe space, especially because I run (it\u2019s recommended to go 1/2 size up) I\u2019m glad I got the 8.5 because they fit perfectly!Overall, these shoes are priced very reasonably, I\u2019d  recommend them.",

The grip is reliable, and the materials are tough enough for daily wear in demanding environments.That said, after about a year of regular use, the original insoles started to wear down, and I noticed some foot fatigue.

        "review": "These are some fantastic work shoes. I bought them off the shoe truck in 2017 when I noticed a lot of co-workers wearing them, now retiring them for a new pair after 2 years in the warehouse.Lugging boots in and out of a sit down and stand up forklift all day can get tiring and even painful once the company starts requiring that mandatory 20 hours of OT at the end of the week. These things are so light weight, my top of foot pain has gone away. I'd actually gone jogging with them once...back in 2017.They have a decent amount of room in the toe area, never get any crowding. The cut-across design of the bottom of the shoe allows for extreme flexibility, meaning when you're squatting down to check that pallet label, the rear and sides of the shoe don't dig into your ankles as much. Pretty comfortable for an uncomfortable position.These things have kicked pallets, kicked boxes, kicked racks, forklifts and even a couple co-workers. I used the toe to drag pallets out on a daily basis, the mesh on top held up pretty well considering how wreckless I am with them.I tried a couple pairs of quality boots, a couple cheap pairs of steel toes from local department stores. These are much cooler and more comfortable than all of those. I'm a very warm mammal and get sweaty from time to time, switching from boots to these have eliminated that issue.The alloy toe means they're very light which is important if you're walking 15,000-20,000 steps a day while jumping in and out of equipment.I think two years is a bit longer than you'd want to stretch it, much of the padding in the heel had disappeared, but I wore these til the day my new ones were delivered with no issues.Adding an additional insole made these even more comfortable. I'm a big guy (240 lbs) so standing 10-12 hours, I need the extra cushion, but the included cushioning would probably suffice for those sit down forklift weeks.Gotta say, if you're on your feet all day and you haven't tried work shoes and have always been a boots person, you need to try these.",

        "review": "While if this was a normal shoe from me it would at least get a 4 star review based on its Comfort, Perceived Durability and Materials Makeup.This shoe will only recieve a 3 star review because of one category Slip Resistance.Slip Resistance - This shoe claims slip resistance. I'm not sure what this is actually for whether its for dirt or whether it's for oil. Typically I see it for oil.(Just a heads up I write this first for the people who depend on this category for work. I do not hate this shoe and rather like it)I will say that this shoe on normal ground (just like your average shoe) grips great but the moment oil is introduced you will start sliding. I work in a manufacturing environment for food where cooking oil is always around.I cannot help but slip all over the floors of my place of work even with the claim these shoes make. I give this category a 1 out of 5Comfort - This shoe is pretty comfortable I would give it a solid 4 out of 5 in that. I had to buy wide as the toe area squished my toes on the first pair I bought.It hugs your shoe but it does have some space between the top of your foot and the top of the shoe. Even after tieing it tightly. Also the Steel Toe in this show is not uncomfortable which is a plus.Percieved Durability - I will say that from what I can see after wearing them for a week is that this shoe will be very durable. It wont be prone to the side walls stretching out due to the reinforcement on the sides. Definitely a 4 out of 5 on thisMaterials Choice - I will say that everything on this shoe feels mostly premium. The mesh is good and not cheaply made and the steel toe is good.The only thing I will say badly about this is that the bottom of the shoe sole does not feel premium and it feels more like foam than it feels like rubber. I will give this a 3 out of 5.Good luck on your purchase. I do actually recommend this product if you wont be working in an oily environment as these will definitely keep your feet safe and comfortable.",

They suck for running even 200m, which we have to do regularly (and further) in CrossFit. Also, the tongue is way too long and digs into the front of my ankle. I would say they are true to size; I\u2019m normally an 8.5 and these are a pretty roomy 8.5. But I would recommend a different shoe for the money. I\u2019m not happy with these and would return them if I hadn\u2019t already worn them a couple times.",

They are soft and comfy but also quite stable.Amazon suggested my normal size (7.5) but I ordered size 8 since I know I'll be wearing footie socks with them for workouts.  I'm glad I ordered up.  But that is because I'm an exact size 7.5 in shoes and often order up for slides and styles that I will wear with socks.I wholeheartedly recommend these for interval/circuit/cross-training.",

The style does flare out a bit wider at toe and heel so if your a person who steps on your feet it might take a minute to adjust. I\u2019m more used to my shoe and sole being the same width. With all that being said I love them and am very happy with the quality and style. Cute and comfy, they are a winner!",

Honestly, I feel like I could climb a mountain, wrestle a bear, and then hit a CrossFit WOD all in the same day with these bad boys on my feet. \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0fFirst off, the comfort is unreal. It\u2019s like Reebok secretly hired a team of NASA scientists to design a shoe that hugs your feet like a clingy toddler. Whether I\u2019m lifting, running, or just strutting around pretending I\u2019m in a sneaker commercial, these kicks have me feeling unstoppable. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude80The grip? Let\u2019s just say I could probably run up a wall like Spider-Man if I really wanted to (I haven\u2019t tried... yet). They\u2019re stable enough to keep me grounded during squats but flexible enough to make burpees almost bearable. Almost.And let\u2019s not ignore the style. These shoes are so sleek that even my non-gym-going friends have been asking, \"Where\u2019d you get those?\" I\u2019ve caught myself looking down at my feet mid-workout and thinking, \"Damn, I look good.\" \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc5fBottom line: The Nano X4s are the Swiss Army knife of sneakers. If you want a shoe that screams, \u201cI\u2019m here to dominate this workout, but I also look cool doing it,\u201d these are for you. Reebok, you\u2019ve outdone yourself. My only complaint? Now I need them in every color. \ud83d\udd25",

Granted, I'm not on my feel all day, but I probably walk more than most office workers.Cons: Nothing significant.Other thoughts:These aren't \"sneakers\" in the way that they make you silent.  The bottom of the shoes are harder than my Nikes, and make a little bit of sound when you walk on a hard floor.  Not an issue unless you're an aspiring ninja.The bottom part of the shoe (the white piece) is larger than your feet.  This gives more stability, but makes your feet look a bit bigger than they are compared with my Nikes.The top of the shoes are breathable.  They are mesh rather than a simple fabric like my Nikes.  As a result, they don't stretch as much.  Just a personal preference which one you like more.Finally - this came in its original shoe box and the box was a bit squashed.

Unfortunately, their \"lasts,\" however, vary a bit and range from normal American (Ds) to somewhat narrow fits.  I've tried three of these. The first and thrid were OK. However, the middle one was much narrower than usual, and the upper part of the heel is not well designed and irritates the heel, at least my heel. So, I had to send it back to Amazon.  The first and third models (including this black one), even of this particular line, fit perfectly.Although, I would say that the first one that I tried (a blue model) was the best of the three for fit etc.",

I personally use them for heavy squats and deadlift as they offer superior stability and support, also they feel so comfortable they can be worn for most exercises. Reebok has bridged the gap between barefoot shoes and workout shoes, weather you\u2019re looking for a casual shoes to wear to the gym that will give you great feel with the wider toe box to intense sessions of powerlifting and CrossFit these are to go shoes. They are flexible yet very well built and constructed from materials that will last and the pair are very light in weight that you will feel comfortable wearing for extended periods of time. When it comes to sizing these for me are true to size, I wear size 11 on the Reebok nano and I find the same size works for these. Reebok well done on these, most exciting shoe release of the year.One more point. Compared to other barefoot workout shoes or low stack height shoes these are perfectly priced compared to other who exaggerate their prices especially that these are made from higher quality material",

Shoe looks good other than branding. I would have preferred a gum colored huge \"Reebok\" if it's got to be there.I have a EE width foot with a large midfoot. The toebox was great, but the distal end of the laces is too far down IMO. The shoe rubs on top of my taller than normal foot at the crease. Removing the insole made the shoe fit perfect, but the shoe isn't made to use without the insole.Shoe seemed solid though. The upper material is nice and breathable. I was really close to keeping the shoe. If my midfoot wasn't abnormally large, i would have kept it.",

They ended up fitting her perfectly & she says they are super comfy to wear when she's out & about for multiple hours. Pretty sure when these start to wear I'll just get her the exact same pair again. Maybe a new Christmas tradition??",

These were on my wish list for a while since I tried them on in a store; I purchased them when the price went down. I wanted white sneakers to wear with dresses. I consider white a neutral color. But compare to Sketchers and Hoka, these have stiff and flat insoles. They\u2019re not uncomfortable, but I already own comfortable sneakers. I returned them.",

        "review": "First the good.  The shoe is lightweight.  Laces stay tied during long runs and the sole of the shoe is comfortable for the most part during runs.  If you are worried about the environment shoe is made from 50% plant based material.  What that exactly is, is not specified anywhere on the shoe.  My geuss would be cotton.  It feels like a canvas type shoe but not as soft.  Shoe fits well enough.  I tend to buy wider shoes but didn't have to with this shoe.  If you have a narrow foot, this shoe might be too big width wise.The bad.  The insole of this shoe does not remove.  It's also just a flat piece glued into the shoe and one could easily add their favorite insole on top and hopefully not lose much space inside the show.  The shoe is made with a rougher material.  Similar to canvas.  Unfortunately there is no additional padding around the Achilles' heel portion of the shoe and the heel tab part of the shoe rides up a little higher than most and doesn't have a notch.  Which leads to my biggest issue.  For me running with this shoe with no-show socks or no socks at all creates a rubbing action against my Achilles' heel and gets very raw and painful.  Even on a short run (3 miles) this becomes an issue.  I have to wear socks that completely cover this area in order to not have the issue.The rubber sole is very thin and seems to be wearing out quite rapidly.  I doubt I will get my normal use (around 500 miles light running) out of these running shoes.  These shoes may be better suited for walking.  I don't recommend them for running shoes because of the issues I observed.UPDATE:  Only used this for running about a month, switched it to a walking shoe and it pretty much fell a part very quickly.  Avoid this shoe, not worth the money.",

I wore them for CrossFit, spinning lessons, cross-training, and weight lifting, and they were simply great. After a few workouts with these Nano ones, I'd like to share my experience.I'll be honest: I was impressed the first time I wore them for leg day. They have enough room in the toe box for weight lifting, are very sturdy, gave me no blisters, but I did notice my feet didn't feel completely comfortable, no arch support (like the CrossFit ones have), and the fit felt off.After a couple of weeks wearing them, my opinion has shifted. These are supposed to be good for cross-training, but if you are doing mild walking and/or prolonged standing with them, your feet will hurt on the toes and the heels. They are ok for weight lifting, considering the fit is not as great as the CrossFit ones, but definitely not for anything that includes walking. These shoes are NOT an improvement. The fit, the comfort, and the sturdiness are just not there. I remember being able to run and jump with the CrossFit ones, so I guess I'm just disappointed. I wish I had gone with the TYR ones.",

        "review": "First the good.  The shoe is lightweight.  Laces stay tied during long runs and the sole of the shoe is comfortable for the most part during runs.  If you are worried about the environment shoe is made from 50% plant based material.  What that exactly is, is not specified anywhere on the shoe.  My geuss would be cotton.  It feels like a canvas type shoe but not as soft.  Shoe fits well enough.  I tend to buy wider shoes but didn't have to with this shoe.  If you have a narrow foot, this shoe might be too big width wise.The bad.  The insole of this shoe does not remove.  It's also just a flat piece glued into the shoe and one could easily add their favorite insole on top and hopefully not lose much space inside the show.  The shoe is made with a rougher material.  Similar to canvas.  Unfortunately there is no additional padding around the Achilles' heel portion of the shoe and the heel tab part of the shoe rides up a little higher than most and doesn't have a notch.  Which leads to my biggest issue.  For me running with this shoe with no-show socks or no socks at all creates a rubbing action against my Achilles' heel and gets very raw and painful.  Even on a short run (3 miles) this becomes an issue.  I have to wear socks that completely cover this area in order to not have the issue.The rubber sole is very thin and seems to be wearing out quite rapidly.  I doubt I will get my normal use (around 500 miles light running) out of these running shoes.  These shoes may be better suited for walking.  I don't recommend them for running shoes because of the issues I observed.UPDATE:  Only used this for running about a month, switched it to a walking shoe and it pretty much fell a part very quickly.  Avoid this shoe, not worth the money.",

I do IT work,  I'm lifting,  squatting,  climbing stairs all day and walking back and forth all day on carpet, tile and outside blacktop. These withstand everything and my feet are always happy in them.  I love how they flex with me and grip the floor especially squatting on my toes, twisting and lifting at the same time. Still after 12 hours of that I still wear them out. They do run a little big so I size down half a size.",

        "review": "Lemme first say, I\u2019m giving 4 stars because for the price, they are a well-made and clean looking, stylish shoe, they\u2019re just not the shoe for me and potentially not for you:First - as someone else said, they run a half size big, so size 1/2 DOWN. Otherwise the heel slippage will be bad on these (not enough of a heel \u201ccup\u201d to keep them on)Even with my own high arch insoles put in, these shoes are STILL not giving enough support against overpronation. And I don\u2019t even have a severe case! I\u2019m starting to get pains reminiscent of shin splints, JUST from walking around with these at work! There are 2 main issues that are causing me to invest in a better shoe:1. Lack of stability - this shoe wasn\u2019t advertised as a stability shoe, so I\u2019m not holding it against them. Just letting you know that if you\u2019re on the fence about these versus a proper stability shoe for your overpronation or arch issues, go for the stability shoe. Even just for casual walking, the support makes a difference.2. Poor \u201cflow\u201d from heel to toe - I think there\u2019s a proper term for this but I forget. Point is, even when walking (and I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d be worse when running), the shoe actually seems to hamper my heel-to-toe movement rather than help it. This is why I bumped down to 4 stars - no matter your foot type, the steps should feel smooth and they don\u2019t here.",

These shoes fit perfectly and are an exact fit. If you have rather wide feet these might not be for you. The colors are really good looking. This is an asteticly pleasing shoe if you are in it for the looks as well. If I saw these in a store I would have easily expected to pay70-80 dollars and they were only 43. Right out of the box I give these shoes a 9/10 just because I don't do cross fit. I say pull the plug if you want these. You won't be disappointed.

The shoes receive positive feedback for their feel, with one customer comparing it to walking on a mattress, and their slip resistance, with good grip and non-slip properties. The fit and durability receive mixed reviews - while some say they fit well, others find them too narrow, and while some report they hold up well, others say they completely fall apart.",

Best steel toe shoe I have ever found that doesn't feel like a steel toe....The only complaint I have is I go through a pair every 3 months and I sit behind a desk I just do alot of walking in the warehouse. Good price for not feeling that steel rubbing on my feet I will continue to buy these shoes",

        "review": "These shoes are awesome. I've worn them for about two weeks now and I am very pleased. I work retail and do a lot of warehousing and I'm on my feet for about 8 hours a day, constantly walking, kicking doors, pushing heavy product across slippery warehouse floors, lifting, crunching boxes, etc.I think I would rate the grip-strength of the tread maybe about a 7 or 8 out of 10. You would probably have to go to an actual boot to do any better.After a full-day each day, my feet are not fatigued or sore with these shoes. They feel like a slightly heavier pair of tennis shoes and I hardly even notice that it has steel toes, but it does!I have not tried jogging in them yet, but so far they feel like another pair of high-quality tennis shoes. One unique thing that I discovered about these shoes the other day, was I had them laced up and needed to take one shoe off. It turns out that the fabric around the ankles has an elastic quality so it stretches so you can take your shoes off without having to untie them.Although, if I had to nit-pick, I would like the laces slightly shorter because the tongue of the shoe is completely fused with the shoes and there's no way to tuck your laces in. This is easy enough to change though.I give these shoes 5 stars!",

They are comfy, though memory foam insole took a bit of getting used to.They are a bit heavy with the steel toe. An aluminum or comp. toe would be a wonderful option. That said, they are still pounds lighter than the Keen safety toed boots I had prior.Great traction in the central NY winter parking lot trek, but mind they are not waterproof and the slush can creep in before getting through the door from the truck.The shoes are holding up very well at this point. I went out of pocket on these and am glad I did. I will buy another pair when these wear out. I'll update the review at that point, but I expect a good two years out them by how they are holding up.I do suggest getting a wide size for toe room, but that holds true with any steel toed shoe/boot, especially if one is prone to ingrown toenails or bunions.Also, I kinda like the fact that I don't wear the same shoes as everyone else in the plant and I get to offer the EHS folks a kick in the shin when they ask me if I have safety toes.. heh",

Uncomfortable as well along the outside portion of the foot on the inside of the shoe.Stability of the shoe is great.Cannot even walk in the shoe without heel slip. Because of this running would be entirely out of the question.The lace lock pull bungee system is entirely pointless because once you tighten it and do any exercises the force of your ankle hitting the bungee pulls the cord rendering the system entirely useless (unless you tie a knot in it of course but then you\u2019d have to get a very tight small knot out of an elastic thin tiny bungee cord)Hole opening for foot is big and poses no issues, I guess by that logic it\u2019s maybe too large creating too much of a gap allowing massive heal slip.I would suggest this show to very narrow footed individuals and people who don\u2019t plan on walking or running in them. Ie people doing more echo bike, skii erg, rowing, etc.I did not do rope climbs in them or plyometrics because I didn\u2019t think the shoes slipping off my feet in those exercises would be safe.These shoes look great and I had high hopes for them but they\u2019re just problematic to use for real training.I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d 275 lb male normally wearing size 13 shoe in all shoes.

Kid is very happy with them and says they are comfortable. They are not coming apart anywhere yet, but I can see that they look very worn on the fabric part - like the logo and everything looks soft and wrinkled and just run down already and it's only been two months. I will say that our kids are more active than most outside and are very tough on any shoes, but I don't foresee these lasting into the school year. For the price and ease of use, I would buy them again, but if you're looking for something that will last for the long haul, this isn't it.",

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that they are a little bit larger (longer) than other major brands size 9. It may be that an 8.5 would be a better fit, but rather than return and exchange for 8.5 (and risk some other unexpected fit, like too narrow), I'll just live with the little bit of extra space in front of the toes. If you are trying to decide between 2 half sizes, you might want to choose the smaller size. That said, I don't know if the extra length is true throughout all the sizes. Maybe size 12 is spot on?

I was nervous that they wouldnt fit my feet given the reviews and even considered buying two sizes/sizing up - I'm glad I didnt. I am a size 8, but sometimes wear a 7.5 in larger shoes i.e. Merrells. In New Balances, I can wear either a 7.5 or 8 usually. I wear an 8 in tevas/old navy flip flops. This shoe is definitely narrow, but I have narrow feet! I actually tried an 8.5 on in person to see if I should size up and let me tell you - I had clown feet. The 8.5 was creepily long on me. So I ordered the size 8 here and they fit perfectly! They're the perfect length for my feet and I actually have a little bit of wiggle room around my ankles so they're easy to slip on and off w/out messing up i.e., crushing the back of the shoe or having to untie them. Longer shoe laces would be nice, but thats something I could get on my own. These shoes don't provide much arch support, but they're comfy for walking around and running errands/being on campus for the day. They do rub a little on the back ankle if you're wearing shorter socks so beware of that - I just wear ankle socks now.This is a super detailed review, but I wanted to actually give some pointers instead of labeling these as good/bad.",

They are light weight and well cushioned. My only caution and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is this.  The sides of the tongue are sewn onto the body of the sneaker so the opening is a little narrow and can't be expanded when you slide you foot in.  I think this would be a problem if you have a wide foot.  I have a more narrow foot so they are perfect for me.

Good arc support as I get plantar fasciitis easy.  I think I ordered up a half size and that was perfect. I have a messed up knee on the right side so these shoes do help with the compensation on the left.  Great Prime Day purchase. Recommend if you need a supportive shoe.Update:  What I loved about the shoes I now dislike.  They cause me more foot /heal pain the longer I wear them. I cannot wear them for extended periods.",

The padded tongue creates a weird pressure point on the top of your foot, and tying them loosely doesn\u2019t help. Maybe if I\u2019d gone up a half size that would have helped, but I didn\u2019t know\u2026 also, there\u2019s not a lot of cushioning so the couple of times I\u2019ve tried to wear these for standing/walking events, my feet ached at the end of the day.My conclusion: order half a size bigger than your normal size and only wear these for shorter periods when you\u2019re not in your feet all day.",

I can just forget that I\u2019m wearing them. No sliding around or hitting a hard wall in the toe box. Just incredible! Heel protection is superb. Lateral stability is good with a natural feel. The insoles are unbelievably good. I usually change the insoles of my shoes because the originals never provide enough arch support, cushioning, or booth. These do a great job. They actually get thicker towards the heel to provide more cushioning but they are thinner in the front so the shoe feels connected to the floor. (I did actually try to replace the insoles with Dr. Scholls, which were marginally better in certain aspects, but they were obviously not designed for these particular shoes so overall they did not work as well together as the originals.) I was concerned about durability because of other reviews and I do see some wear after 2 months, but not more than other shoes I had. (For reference, I play pickleball at about 3.5-4.0 level twice a week.) I also really like the heel-to-toe drop, which makes them feel like sneakers and stretch my achilles/calf muscles noticeably less providing some relief.",

I ordered a half size up, as someone who walks everywhere and for good amounts of distance each day, I thought maybe they'd be perfect. For a size 7 women's shoes, I struggled to get my whole foot inside, and even all the way in I was horribly uncomfortable. Walking did not help, in fact it made my arches aches something fierce.My excitement got the better of me, I'd waited months for the shoes to go on sale and when they did, just in time for my birthday, I jumped at the chance.Definitely order a size full size up or look for a wide version if available; especially if you're like me and walk everywhere.",

I even bought a size down or so because the reviews said it ran big. It was still oversized even for my wide foot and it still was uncomfortable because the whole shoe was not pliable to move in. I've purchased enough shoes in my lifetime to know if the material will loosen up with time and wear. I knew these sneakers would not ever feel good. So, back they went.",

And then I couldn't find them any more, although from time to time  I'd search again. Well, here they are! I have been trying every sneaker--Hoka, On Cloud, cushioned Converse, you name it, I've tried but kept wishing for something less bulky, less crazy looking, more comfortable. These arrived today and they are just as I remember--perfect fit in my usual size, really comfortable, on and on. I'm ordering a couple more because I'm so afraid they'll disappear again. Also trying a high top version, which will be better for hiking. I feel like I'm finally ready to get back to traveling with extremely comfortable all-day walking shoes that could also go off road onto trails--or look ok in a restaurant.",

        "review": "In the last 6 months I have discovered that finding a pair of breathable hard toe shoes, that also are actually wide, and have arch support is apparently to much to ask.  I will admit I have an odd size foot at 11.5 4E, I've tried atleast 12 different brands now and to this point these shoes are the only one that comes close to fitting my size.  Most notably for me, they have a wide enough toe box that I can walk a lot and not get blisters, note that they are not perfect, however if you need some breathability as well these might be your best bet.  I also got the composite toe and it's been light enough not to really notice and does not set off metal detectors.Note:  if you have a flat or fallen arch the support may be great for you, that said if you have any arch, or like me have a decent arch you will want to like at getting an insert or additional support.  For this reason I've rated it a 4/5 stars, I have worn Reebok shoes before and these by far have the least comfortable insole of any I've worn before.  I think it has to do with the materials they used to help them be rated for industrial use, that said I still find it hard to beleive that Reebok would approve a shoe with such a lack of support.Overall, if your looking for a safety she that has a wide toe box, is breathable, and has a composite toe you probably wont find a better option.  I recommend using Amazon Wardrobe to try these out, I could not find anyone that had these in stock to try on and out city us a decent size.",

The toe area is wide (I don't have wide feet), of course that has more to do with the safety toe than anything, but the 12s length is still a little big on me too. They're not overly loose or uncomfortably big, just a little extra room than I probably would have chosen had I tried them on in a store, but not enough to justify returning them. They are the most \"normal\" looking safety toe shoes I've seen and I don't think most people would even notice unless I told them.

        "review": "Let me tell you about these shoes.  These run about 1/2 size too small. The width is accurate; however it is necessary to get the proper width because they don't give and relax like leather shoes .  The synthetic leather is sewn over a non giving Inner  \"shoe\".  That firm inner liner gives these gym shoes a lot of support and structure.  These will hold their shape for the life of the shoes.  They are very sturdy.  There is a band around the front of the shoe.  That gives additional structure.  They have a cushioned insole.  They have good arch support.  It supports exactly where it should on the arches. The tongue is padded and the heel area is padded.  The laces aren't overly long.  The gym shoes are lightweight.  On the feet, they look like good leather gym shoes.  They don't get those ugly creases in them.The insole is comfortable.  The synthetic leather is soft, but that is not felt because it is sewn over that inner shoe. The inner liner is soft, but firm.  The top of the shoe, before the laces have some \"play\".  That one area is softer. The rest of the  shoe is firm, non giving and will stay that way by design.  That's why getting the proper width is important.  The feet feel very supported.  These are nothing like those popular mesh gym shoes.Now, there are  two sole attached to these shoes. The first is flexible.  The second is not. It does not give.  It feels hard while walking.  The second sole is the one that is treaded.  It is deeply treadedThese shoes are not for running.  For anyone that has lost a lot of knee cartilage just know the last sole is  hard and inflexible.  If it wasn't,  these would be an absolute dream come true for anyone with knee issues.  Since it is so firm, initially they don't maneuver  easily in all directions while walking.  That's important for anyone with knee problems. They do absorb shock  and have lots of cushioning. The entire sole is almost 2\".  They are well worth trying, because they absorb so much shock and pressure off the knees  while walking. Note the photos;  the heel is designed so that  wearer has to heel strike first.  It's not an option. That is the proper way to begin walking.  That takes further pressure off the knee joint......I'm a Massage Therapist.I really don't think you will find a better shock absorbing shoe.  The more you walk in them the more thick cushioned sole is felt; the less the hard sole is felt,  and the feet are able to adjust to movement in all directions.  When first trying them on they just feel so hard.  That leaves after about a day of wearing.  After first trying them on my initial reactions was to send them right back.  Don't get discouraged when first trying them on.  Give them a chance. The knees will thank you.This is a good pair of shoes for people without knee problems for sure.  These make good works shoes  and they really look attractive, too.  I love the way they look, especially the all white.  It's a bright true white.  They look so fresh.  They make a nice  dress up gym shoe for me.  I know I'm glad I found them and I hope this review helps someone else.I purchased the white and black. For whatever reason the black runs a little smaller than the white.  I noticed that is true of Reebok's Princess Lite shoe as well.",

This pair was superior to the other brand I bought (I\u2019m not naming the other brand because I don\u2019t have beef with them; I just love these Reeboks). My feet are not hurting at all like they were before buying these shoes! Plus they look great too! The quality and value for the price is unmatched in my opinion!The only things I will mention that some may not like, but that don\u2019t bother me at all, these shoes are a bit hot. They are fully lined, padded leather, which I think is super comfy, but they do get hot. But I have completely gotten use to that now.

I had read the other reviews about their being tight, but I completely disregarded them because I had already received the aforementioned pair which fit perfectly.  Also, I figured if these fit a little snug, I would stretch them out over time.  Last, the term \"X-wide\" left visions of clown shoes in my head.  Big mistake!When the regular size arrived last week, they were VERY tight.  There was no way I could have worn them for any length of time.  I had to send the regular size 8 ones of these back immediately and received the replacement size 8 X-wide ones today.  HUGE improvement!  They feel great, look great and will be perfect for my needs. If you normally wear a narrow size, these shoes will work for you.  Otherwise, order the X-wide!Love my new Reeboks and can't wait to hit the ground in them!",

The comfort is excellent thanks to the soft cushioning and reliable arch support, which makes them easy to wear all day. The quality of the leather and gum sole feels premium, while still being lightweight and breathable, which is a big plus for warmer days.In terms of fit, they run true to size and feel secure without being too tight. The look is timeless \u2014 clean and classic with a gum bottom that matches with just about anything. Durability also stands out, since the build feels sturdy and made to last with regular wear.What makes it even better is the value for money. You\u2019re getting a well-made, stylish shoe that combines comfort, wearability, and long-lasting quality without breaking the bank.",

They are a little narrow but expected for a women\u2019s shoe. That worked for me but the width of my feet are pretty average and they did stretch a tiny bit.  Easily able to clean them with a damp towel.  They\u2019re super stylish and can be worn with jeans, shorts, a dress, or slacks.",

        "review": "Review: Reebok Club C Double Platform SneakersI\u2019ve been wearing the Reebok Club C Double Platform sneakers for a while now, and they\u2019ve definitely become a go-to in my rotation. If you\u2019re into classic silhouettes with a modern twist, these are a great choice.Style:The platform sole gives the traditional Club C design a fresh, elevated look\u2014literally. It adds just the right amount of height without feeling over-the-top. They pair well with everything from joggers and jeans to dresses and skirts, which makes them super versatile for casual or slightly dressed-up looks.Comfort:Surprisingly comfy for a platform sneaker. The cushioning is solid, and the shoe feels stable and supportive, even after a long day on your feet. I wouldn\u2019t call them ultra-lightweight, but they\u2019re definitely not clunky either.Fit:They run true to size in my experience. The leather upper is snug at first but breaks in nicely after a few wears. If you have wider feet, you might want to consider going half a size up, especially if you wear thick socks.Quality:Reebok did a great job with the materials\u2014good leather, clean stitching, and a durable sole that holds up well. They\u2019re easy to clean too, which is a bonus if you like that fresh-out-the-box look.Final Verdict:If you\u2019re looking for a sneaker that balances retro vibes with a modern edge, the Reebok Club C Double Platform is a solid pick. Stylish, comfortable, and versatile\u2014definitely worth it.\u2e3b",

In pretty much all other brand shoe I wear a 11 us size so bear that in mind when you purchase.  If you use the size guide and put in your normal size it will tell you the same size is recommended but do not do this as it will not be enough to room. Goe one size bigger for good toe room",

They grip to the ground, so I'm not slipping as much when I'm on, say like, a slicker surface, and it's a safety tip at the front. It's amazingGive this shoe a five out of five",
