I've been wearing ASICS for a long time now, sticking with their Kayano models for exercise, and these are definitely more narrow than those. I haven't worn them long enough yet to speak on how much stability they offer, so I might update this when I get to wear them more. For 1/2 to 1/3 of the price of the ASICS I usually buy, these might be my \"running errands\" shoes and not ones I exercise in or plan to wear when I'm going to be on my feet for long periods of time.",

If these are wide (don't appear so other than saying it) I'm sure the reg 10.5 would have been too tight.There was mention/reviews of the short shoelaces...yeah, if you use all the holes it will leave you just enough to tie them good. No extra hanging lace to trip on.... Hence, they are jogging shoes!Laces also seem thinner and cheaper than most laces I've seen but also strategic.

It was the pair of shoes I used to travel, walk, and simply wear for an everyday casual wearing. Just on the walking part alone I put no less than 500 miles.I slip in these when I travel. I can literally wear them for multiple days without worry my feet would eventually start to hurt. Trust me I\u2019ve done 24+ itineraries there\u2019s no other shoe that can match these in comfort. It looks stylish and slick, they never seem out of place.They are soft but will keep you grounded. If you prone to getting your ankles sprained these shoes are perfect.

The all black pair has always been my safe shoe with black jeans for casual looks and they blend in nice for a casual work look too. I bought a pair of the 5x ultraboost about 4 months ago, and within the first month, they were already falling apart. the bottom of the shoe was slowly peeling off, the black around the edge of the base ripped off too, I've never had a pair fall apart so quickly.Fast forward to now, I buy the 1.0 because they're more similarly shaped to ultraboosts I've purchased in the past because I'm going on a long vacation and need great walking shoes. I wore these to a baseball game to break them in and after mostly sitting, my left foot was killing me for a week. I tried loosening them, but no matter what the material under the tongue DRIVES into the top of your foot and hurts so much. That was two weeks ago, and I just told myself I need to break them in... WRONG! They still hurt and my foot is killing me. Money wasted, and now I need to find a new walking shoe because Adidas' quality has completely tanked.",

Parts of the sole are also coming unglued. I don\u2019t wear these very often and I\u2019ve had adidas that lasted 2yrs before the shoe has worn down.

I\u2019ve shared photos of what they looked like, immediately after opening the package from Amazon- just not happy about the fact that I thought I was buying BRAND NEW shoes, which these were obviously not! Since he needed the shoes now, I decided to not return them, but just wanted to leave this review to let others know what I experienced. Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe\u2026is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I\u2019ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width\u2026super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they\u2019d be slippery, but my husband says they\u2019re really not. The insoles are not as soft as his other pair (different style), but he says they feel like they\u2019ll be more durable!So I\u2019d definitely leave a 5 star review for the shoes themselves, but 3-star was given simply because they were not new, as described.",

        "review": "Pros: I\u2019ve been very happy with Adidas shoes in the past, and these are no exception: great shoes! I thought I\u2019d ordered black, but the shoes that came were actually a dark blue. For me, this was a positive because the blue is a surprisingly nice look. They feel sturdy, support my foot in all the right places, fit near perfectly, and are very comfortable to wear. Another plus for me is that they shed my dog\u2019s fur. We have a Lab that sheds like she just left the North Pole for the Sahara desert, so this was a huge and pleasant surprise. Finally, the cost of these is astoundingly inexpensive. I\u2019ve paid twice the price for shoes that weren\u2019t this comfortable.Cons: so far the only con I\u2019ve found is that the material of the soles tend to grab my socks as I\u2019m putting on the shoes. It takes a bit of doing to put on the shoes without having part of my sock pulled and folded underneath my foot. Normally this would be a big deal for me, but the shoes are so nice otherwise that it\u2019s simply not a big deal.Unknown: longevity. The pair of Adidas that this pair is replacing is 3 years old without any real issues other than I wore the soles through. Time will tell if these will hold up in a similar manor.",

They are not as narrow in fit as many of the shoes out there.  They have a nice width across the metatarsals for someone needing a slightly wider fit.  The tongue fits well in the shoe with no uncomfortable rubbing.  I have a very high instep and find some shoes are difficult to get on and become very tight across the top of my foot, no problem with that with this shoe's fit. The heel is a good height with a secure fit and has not caused any tenderness in that area.  These shoes are an excellent lightweight, nice looking, and comfortable everyday shoe.  In fact, I have enjoyed them so much that I have bought a second pair.  Highly recommended.",

They were much narrower and the sizing was off in comparisons to the 1 and 2. Brooks running shoes started to give me a pain on top of my foot. Similar to a stress fracture. So got the 3 kaptir in the closet and ran and pain went away. I like a roomy toe box when running and these 3 are not that in comparison to 1 and 2. So I ordered half a size bigger in the kaptir 3 and then also ordered my normal size in the kaptir 4 and I\u2019m very happy with the fit the comfort and the roomy toe box. Would say so far better than the 2. Haven\u2019t ran with them yet but will. Overall this is a great shoe. Never again will I waste money on brooks. The bad thing is a shoe might feel good when you try them on in the store and then once you run in them and spend time on your feet in them then you find out whether the shoe is great, good or horrible. I do treadmill running and the best success I\u2019ve had with brands is adidas kaptir. New balance several pairs have been horrible, Pegasus 39 have been horrible for running but great walking shoe, numerous other adidas, one time a puma. So far adidas surpasses brooks, Nike, puma, new balance for running.",

Couldn't be happier they are super light and comfortable that cloud foam definitely takes a lot of the pressure off of your legs. While I love my Air Max 90s these for a quarter of the price where worn 90% of the time walking around on my trip because they were so comfortable in that saying a lot seeing as the Air Max 90 is one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned so I would say these are full five Stars based on price their ability and comfort plus they look kind of retro love them!!!!!",

        "review": "Compr\u00e9 los Adidas Run 72 para hombre en Amazon y no podr\u00edan haber superado mis expectativas. Estos tenis combinan un dise\u00f1o retro inspirado en los a\u00f1os 70 con un toque moderno que los hace perfectos para uso casual. El color blanco con negro que eleg\u00ed es elegante y vers\u00e1til, ideal para combinar con jeans o ropa deportiva.Comodidad: La amortiguaci\u00f3n Cloudfoam es un gran punto a favor; se sienten ligeros y c\u00f3modos desde el primer uso, como si caminaras sobre una nube. La plantilla de espuma con memoria ofrece un soporte excelente, especialmente para estar de pie o caminar durante varias horas. La parte superior de malla y cuero sint\u00e9tico es transpirable, manteniendo mis pies frescos incluso en d\u00edas calurosos.Calidad: Los materiales, aunque no son premium, son duraderos y bien ensamblados. La suela de goma ofrece buen agarre en superficies urbanas, aunque puede ser un poco resbaladiza en suelos mojados. Los detalles de gamuza y las ic\u00f3nicas tres rayas le dan un look aut\u00e9ntico y robusto. Llevo us\u00e1ndolos varias semanas y siguen como nuevos.Talla y ajuste: Ped\u00ed mi talla habitual (US 9.5 ) y me quedaron perfectos, aunque algunos comentarios mencionan que pueden sentirse un poco grandes. Recomiendo medir bien tus pies o consultar la gu\u00eda de tallas de Amazon para mayor seguridad. El ajuste es c\u00f3modo, pero si usas plantillas ortop\u00e9dicas, considera pedir media talla m\u00e1s.Precio y env\u00edo: Los consegu\u00ed en oferta. La relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio es imbatible para unos Adidas originales.Conclusi\u00f3n: Los Adidas Run 72 son una gran elecci\u00f3n si buscas unos tenis con estilo retro, c\u00f3modos y asequibles. Perfectos para el uso diario, caminatas ligeras o simplemente para lucir bien. \u00a1Los recomiendo totalmente y probablemente comprar\u00e9 otro par en un color diferente!",

I ordered my usual size, and it felt like my toes were at a clown car convention. So, I had to send them back and get a size up. In ten years of buying Adidas, this was a first\u2014like finding out your favorite coffee shop suddenly sells 5 dollar-foot longs. Not a deal-breaker, just a quirky surprise.Other than that, they\u2019re stylish and true to the photos. No Photoshop magic here, folks.

There is room for an insole/orthotic/ arch support without taking out the insole they come with.They offer support but not enough cushioning for running. Better to get options like Adidas  alphabounce or New Balance fresh foam x or good budget high foam runners like  Allswifit.These adidas are very much like a cozy pair of moccasins you love.

When I first put them on, I felt they were a little snug around the sides. I walked around in them when I took my kids for a walk, then took them off for the day. However, the next day, I slipped them on, and BAM, they fit like a glove! For my high arch they provide enough support. Even with no-show socks on, the rim of the shoe has yet to give me blisters. They feel snug enough where if I run I don\u2019t feel like they will come off, but not so snug where they are uncomfortable. I believe they are designed for a more \u201ccustom feel\u201d, thus why they may feel snug or tight initially. For my size 7 foot, they fit nicely. I do not run, so I cannot comment on how practical they are as a running shoe. But as a mom of two kids under 5, I can vouch for their comfort as an every day sneaker.",

        "review": "Fantastic shoe...I bought these having never worn Adidas running shoes. I did have an Adidas hiking shoe that was indestructible, but eventually wore out. I have been wearing Nike Pegasus for years. The Pegasus fit and feel is great, especially for a narrow foot. Price had become too costly, like most shoes. So after some time watching and reading reviews, I took a gamble on the Supernova Prima. Only a few days in to wearing, I have zero complaints. They feel like plush toys. Mind you, I walk; very little running, no high mileage, etc. just day to day wearing to work and for exercise.They are lightweight, and roomier than the Pegasus in the forefoot. I should also point out that they probably run a half size bigger. I wear a men's 12D. But I'm keeping these - colder months, room for thicker socks. The semi-gusseted tongue is also great; a soft, thin, pillowtop-esque portion of tongue is unique to this shoe. The upper is soft like a jersey feel. I wish the outsole was more like the waffle of a Nike or even had the Adidas Continental rubber, but not a dealbreaker.I put non-custom orthotics in mine. Heel feels cushiony and ball of foot is the same, bounce like.I'll admit the hyper turquoise accent color is awful. And if you go for the most current model, color selection is terrible. Not sure why Adidas would choose chain gang gray/highlighter and light communist gray as the 2 color options instead of anything else, but they did.If I can update review after 3 months, I can speak to durability. Will be walking in these all summer. Feet happy.",

I feel like my strides are light and I get a lot of cushioning. I have walked dozens of miles in a day with these and enjoyed myself at concerts and shows too with no foot ache or cramp to speak of afterwards. Just wish they looked a bit more sleek like the original run, but you get the benefit of comfort and performance for a great daily walker and they're priced well enough you can beat on it without feeling bad. I'd likely pickup another pair just to rotate designs and keep them both looking a bit less beat up overtime. If you are looking for ideal running shoes, these are not bad but you are probably better served with something for even more high-impact that doesn't completely \"deaden\" the floor underneath you with the cushioning while still providing good return for energy spent. In other words, these are light, but not light enough for performance running, but in the excellent sweet spot for daily wear and even easy jogging, basketball, and light sports or long hikes on even terrain (I would recommend more proper trail shoes with better grip for more imbalanced terrain).",

The actual small area on the top does not really vent the heat from my feet adequately.At this point, 2 days after receipt, the only issue I see is the shoe is without question the most difficult to put on shoe I have ever owned.There are no finger loops on the heel nor tongue.Without finger loops you are forced to awkwardly spear the front of your foot into the shoe and employ either you fingers (sucks) or in my case a long handled shoe horn to slide your foot into the shoe.More to come as further investigation is allowed.",

As a woman wearing men's sizes they can be tightened a good bit for a narrow foot. Unfortunately they saved by loosing some breathability. They are comfortably warm with mid weight socks in 85\u00b0 but wouldn't be ideal for seriously warm summer hiking. The back of the ankle is taller than many shoes, which took some breaking in. Lastly, when tightened I notice some warping of the water repellent around the toes, so I suspect they may not be super durable, but I'm sure they'll get through a few months/few hundred miles.TLDR: good for their price, a little toasty",

Oh, and occasionally I'd add a comfort pad if I knew it'd be a long day on my feet; but quite honestly, they're cushy soft anyway and found it was not necessary.  My feet were never sore at any time or even by the end of a long walking day; amazing!Second.  They did get a little dirty, and even more so at home from constant wear (love them so much).  I have thrown them in a snug garment bag multiple different times, tossed them in the washing machine on a cold water wash and they wash up beautifully without any damage or breakdown to the shoes - but air dry them.Third.  They are so fashionable.  They not only feel great but they look fantastic with everything you wear.  I've had so many unexpected compliments on them.  As I mentioned before, I also bought the silver/green pair.  They're gorgeous.  What a great color!So overall, I am SUPER happy with the style, fit, durability and comfort of these shoes.  I'd give them 100 stars if I could.",

        "review": "I absolutely love these adidas! I had the previous model of these shoes, that is very similar. They have made a few minor changes on this model. The ankle area is a slightly different shape and the front of the shoe seems to have a little added structure. Overall it\u2019s very similar to the previous model but does look a tiny bit different and more updated. I do like this model better! I am a big fan of adidas cloudfoam. I love that you can tie them once and slip them on and off. Obviously they are super comfortable, hence the name cloudfoam. I have washed my previous model in the washing machine (air dry) and they have always come out fine. I use them for everyday and also walking my dog for exercise. I have one pair for exercise and one pair for casual wear with jeans and leggings. They are super cute and easily go with everything due to the neutral colors offered. They look feminine and stylish. The previous model of this shoe I have in size 7.5 and this model I have in a size 8. I noticed that people weren\u2019t saying this shoe runs as large as the previous model did, so that\u2019s why I ordered my normal size 8. I\u2019m glad I did, they fit perfectly. I would recommend these for everyday or for walking/exercise. Personally I would not recommend these for long distance running because I think this is more of a low impact walking shoe in my opinion. Maybe this would be fine for running for some, but back when I was running (I just walk now due to an injury) I would\u2019ve picked a shoe with a thicker sole and more shock impact protection. Everyone is different. I have tried to run in these and they weren\u2019t as good as my Nike revolution 5 running shoe. They weren\u2019t terrible for running though, there\u2019s just better choices imo! Overall these shoes are great! I would imagine this would be a great shoe if you are on your feet all day.  Side note, to all you moms out there who live in leggings like me (lol) these look super cute paired with leggings!",

I\u2019m not a big runner, so I can\u2019t speak to how they\u2019d hold up for serious running, but I imagine they might wear out too quickly if used for that.For my purposes, they\u2019re great. I wear them every day for walks, and they usually last me about 4\u20135 months before the soles start to wear down and they begin to look a little dirty. That said, even after that point, I still keep using them\u2014they\u2019re that comfortable.They go with everything, feel super lightweight, and are easy to slip on and off. Highly recommend if you\u2019re looking for an everyday sneaker for walking, errands, or light workouts!",

Only problem is they sent me a 8 1/2.  At first I was devastated because these are the cutest most comfortable shoes I\u2019ve ever had. (Not exaggerating.)However they do run big, lengthwise, so they fit.  They were too tight at the opening and since there\u2019s no tongue, I thought they\u2019d never fit.  However after breaking them in by walking around the house and manually stretching that spot, they do fit.  I\u2019m afraid to exchange for a 9, because they would be too long.  My feet already have a little wiggle room in the 8 1/2 and the mesh is ever so slightly stretchy.  I\u2019d recommend getting your usual size, unless your feet are very wide, in that case size up. I would size down if you have VERY narrow feet.  I hope this helps. They\u2019re adorable and I can\u2019t wait to wear them teaching all day!",

They\u2019re stable, breathable, and surprisingly light, with just the right amount of firm cushioning to keep my feet supported from clock-in to clock-out. No break-in period was needed\u2014they were comfortable from day one.I normally wear a size 11.5, but I went with a 12 wide for a little extra space. I\u2019ve got a foot condition, and this gave me enough room for healing without feeling loose or sloppy. The added width helped relieve pressure on my toes, and the fit still felt secure around the heel and midfoot. That small adjustment in size made all the difference for long hours and recovery.The cushioning is more firm than soft, which I actually prefer for standing all day. It holds up under pressure and gives real support without collapsing. Even after 10+ hours, my feet don\u2019t ache or feel beat up. The mesh upper keeps air flowing, and the shoe feels lightweight without sacrificing durability.After reading other reviews, I\u2019ve found my experience lines up\u2014people mention walking thousands of steps comfortably, and many say it\u2019s one of the best options for long-term wear. Some recommend sizing up slightly if you\u2019re between sizes, especially for a wider toe box. I\u2019d agree with that.Overall, this isn\u2019t just a good running shoe\u2014it\u2019s a great all-day work shoe. It\u2019s built for comfort, stability, and endurance. Whether you\u2019re on a hard surface all day or just need something dependable for recovery, this pair won\u2019t let you down.",

I am very glad that I listened to this advice. When I first got the shoes, even at size 11 they still seemed a bit small, but now after using them for a couple of weeks they have broken in and fit just right! So now they do fit, but with like no extra room. If you like a little extra room in your shoes then go with 1 full size larger.

At first, I thought the sole on these was so bizarre in the heel that I nearly returned them. However, I ended up deciding to give them a try anyway and I was SO pleasantly surprised!! I LOVE how wide the toe box is and they are very supportive. They're a little chunky because of the thick heel, but overall they're pretty light and super comfortable. Great value for quality. I've had them for a few months now and have already put quite a bit of wear on them, and they're still very comfortable. I haven't experienced any pain/blistering and they're helping my knees as I'm doing PT and getting back into my hobby. Very happy I found these!",

These have a good mesh amount to keep your feet cool but enough solid area to keep them dry if you are dealing with minimal amounts of water. The heel is a bit bulky but provides a lot of extra support. I love the bright orange color. I always try to get bright colors for hiking gear just in case I need to be seen. The only complaint I have is that they are tad narrow. I have a narrow foot, and these are snug on me. It's not an uncomfortable amount though. They will also stretch more as I wear them in. Length wise they are true to size. I wear a 7 and these have the perfect amount of room between the tip of the shoe and the tip of my big toe. If I went a half size bigger for width they would be too long. I have another pair of Adidas I wear to the gym that I had to go half a size smaller (Adidas Swift Run).

They have very good heel support and the toe is great, with good support and springy take off! The toe box is very comfortable on my size 13 normal width (D) feet. I like the reinforced eyelets. Very good traction. The arch support is very nice too. They feel light and lively.The BAD: The shoe strings are crap and will definitely get replaced. The tongue is non-gusseted but has a loop on the tongue that allows the second and third lace to go through it and help control positioning. I prefer a gusseted tongue.These are brand new, I just got them today. Opened the box and went for a quick 5 mile run so can't speak to durability.

The original web description was worded differently and it, along with Amazon\u2019s product page, identifying the sizes as \u201cWide\u201d were what I'd trusted and based my purchase on. The web search is misleading when one asks if this specific shoe model comes in \u201cwide\u201d and this plus Amazon\u2019s product page are wrong! The Adidas website does not have wide sizes either. Buyer beware.In my actual wear experience and going by the shoe tag and box, these shoes are not truly \u201cwide,\u201d and they hurt my feet. I will notify Amazon to change the width to regular or standard, from \u201cwide.\u201d__________Original review: I purchased these in size 6.5 Wide in Men's sizing. Amazon was the only carrier of the Wide version at the time. My typical women's size is 7 to 7.5 extra wide. I usually need an extra wide width due to two bilateral bunions, which make my feet sensitive with any pressure. My usual shoes are Brooks and New Balance. Runrepeat gave these shoes a high rating and, after reading their research about the toe box width, toe box height, great durability, and the customer reviews from other sites, I ordered these. I dislike spending full price, but this shoe brand and style/type (+ width) have sold quickly. They are my favorite sports shoes, stable, lightweight, and are comfortably cushioned. Worth the full price, imo. (See revised review above.)",

Affordable, worth every penny I paid. the color is unmistakable so when i walk at night i am definitely seen. they are very thin and lightweight material. when they came in the mail today i thought there was going to be only one shoe in there because of how lightweight the package was. too bad winter is coming soon. i live in chicago and i definitely won't be able to wear these in the snow and rain. that is the only downside. other than that, i want these shoes for the rest of my life!!",

But quite difficult without one, because of the stretchy sock that helps keep your foot in place during long runs.  This shoe is most known for its comfort, and ability to give help in forward propulsion when your heel hits the ground.  The effect is not as pronounced as some Nikes, that also have a higher differential between heel height and front of shoe.  For folks accustomed to Zero naked feet flat shoes, these can be too much heellThese wash beautifully in the washing machine.  But don\u2019t put them in the dryer.",

I usually have to rotate shoes or sneak in a pair of sandals mid-day, but not this time. These Ultraboosts were light, breathable, and so ridiculously cushioned that I started referring to them as my \u201cwalking clouds.\u201d I\u2019m not even kidding.The Grey/White/Blue color combo is even better in person, stylish enough to match all my park outfits but subtle enough that they didn\u2019t scream \u201cnew shoes at a theme park.\u201d They\u2019re sleek, cute, and made me feel like I was walking on memory foam wrapped in marshmallows.Fit-wise, they were perfect right out of the box. I didn\u2019t even have to break them in (which is a Disneyland miracle). I wear a size 9 and found them true to size with just enough wiggle room for swelling after 12 hours on my feet.Bonus: they didn\u2019t stain or scuff easily, even after a churro mishap and a surprise splash from Pirates of the Caribbean. Clean-up was easy, and they still look brand new.If you\u2019re headed to the parks or just need something comfy for all-day errands, buy these. Your feet will thank you. Mine are still applauding.",

But omg they hurt so bad. First thing I did was try them on in the house and they squeaked but I figured, eh maybe that will stop. Thankfully once there was some dirt on them, it did. They also felt a bit snug around the top of my foot but I figured eh, maybe that will loosen over time because obviously loosening up the ties does nothing on a shoe with a built in tongue. They were comfortable in all the other ways, but it did not loosen. I wore these on a trip to Las Vegas and the tops of my feet hurt SO bad by the end of day 2 of walking around. I wore sandals off and on for the rest of the trip and absolutely dreaded putting them back on for the airplane ride home. That's when I noticed my feet were legit BRUISED on top, from the weird pressure under the laces on my foot. There is no way to fix it and if it happens to you, just know that it won't loosen. You will hate these shoes that are so comfortable in every other way.I even went so far as to googling this issue, where I landed on the many Reddit threads full of other people wondering what in the world is going on with these shoes. I don't think it's just me. I have pretty small feet and I do not have high arches at all. Buy these at your own risk.",

I used to be a Nike Vaporfly fan, but due to a past injury that keeps flaring up, I couldn't wear them anymore, and so I decided to give these a shot, and boy they felt amazing. Plus, they don't give me that 'hot shoe' foot feel (nor blisters) after my runs unlike my Nike Vaporfly ones. Really happy with these shoes. Only down side though is the sizing.

Lightweight ones, max cushion, racers, and let me tell you if I could start over and have 1 shoe, THIS is it.I didn\u2019t even notice this shoe on my 8 mile long slow run at 11:00/mile easy pace. It zoomed right on during 4:30/mile pace strides. It handled my 8:00 tempo pace with ease. Everything about this shoe executes without complication. It is simply seamless.I don\u2019t mean to glaze, I\u2019m just genuinely so impressed.This is a firmer shoe. If you weigh 110lbs I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll like it. As an average 175lb guy, this is money. It has a lot of bounce with the foam and the rods (used instead of a plate). The continental outsole grip is insane and super planted. Very stable as well.The upper is not perfect. I need a runners loop to get a semi decent heel lock down. Not a deal breaker, everything else is 10/10.If someone asked me what shoe do I buy for all of my runs I\u2019d tell them this. New runner? This. First 5K, 10K or half shoe? This. Long run shoe?

If you\u2019re a runner or walker this would definitely be a good shoe to buy.",

        "review": "So I ordered these shoes back in late May because I needed new shoes for walking and own numerous pairs of Adidas sneakers. Well these caught my eye and were on sale for under $40 so obviously I bought them! Well when they arrived I tried them on and they literally looked like I was ready for the circus because they were so big. I wear a size 7 to a 7.5 in my fully enclosed shoes. Since I planned to wear thicker socks and a killer sale price I ordered a 7.5. Well these have to be a men\u2019s size because they were so big but comfortable. Well I went to order a smaller size and was shocked that they were double the cost. So I returned them and ordered two other styles in 3 different sizes, only to keep one pair in a size 7. I still wanted these but at the $40 price point, so I watched and waited. While waiting, returning other pairs, and reading ALL reviews I had a better idea of the size that would probably work. Obviously the size chart wasn\u2019t accurate and didn\u2019t help the first time. Finally after after 2 months the price dropped and I ordered the replacement pair in a size 6.5. I tried them on and they are still a little big even with thick socks on but not bad enough for another return. A size 6 would be perfect with toe wiggle room but these will work. They are extremely padded especially around the Achilles tendon and ankle portion. The cushion almost has a \u201cgel\u201d padding feel and surrounds the outer part of the foot. So my other pairs of Adidas sneakers range from a 5 to a 7! This brand doesn\u2019t seem to be consistent with size but are worth it when you find your fit. These are noticeably heavier on then most sneakers but that is do to the really thick shock absorbing sole and the padding. However it\u2019s not heavy enough for me to give up the comfort. I have clubbed toes on my left foot and this shoe doesn\u2019t bother me. So in conclusion I went from a 7.5 down to a 6.5 and could\u2019ve easily worn a 6! So I would suggest sizing down at least a half size down minimal. I expect they\u2019ll last me at least a year or more easily with this being used as a primary daily shoe. So be prepared for a possible return or wearing thicker socks. I hope this helps and good luck with your purchase!",

        "review": "When I write reviews I like to be thorough so as to help people truly make an informed decision, so, here goes: The shoe is GREAT looking in person, the white color scheme I chose goes with everything, which is important to a person like me who always needs to match. The comfort of the shoe is 5 stars, it's like working out on a cloud, and I don't say that lightly. The shoe hits 5 stars for everything BUT..the sizing. It's never easy going through sizing discrepancy reviews because there's never enough detail or comparison, I'm gonna give you some. The size 10 shoe, is going for $26, 2 weeks ago, I ordered the 9.5 and it was on sale for $39. Now 9.5 is up & the size 9, only the size 10 is for $26 because the sizing is so off I'll bet they are stuck with a bunch of returns and regular inventory for that size. I got the 9.5 cheaper than it is now and I think the price went up because normal size 10 wearers grew aware of this so went for the next size down, and the one after that, driving the price up, which is my only issue with this product or seller. Shoes should be the same price across the board like they've always been but consumers are now having to pay more for the sellers not being detailed enough in their product as to write a product description that would aide consumers in choosing the right size and lowering returns & exchanges. I am normally between a 9.5 & 10 shoe size. For heels it's usually a 10, with the rare shoe still being too small. For a tennis shoe it's usually a 9.5 as a 10 is usually too big, except for the rare occasion it's just right. To give you an idea of my foot: I am 5'9, 130lbs, I am built long, bony, & muscular but my hands & feet don't have an ounce of fattie tissue on them & they don't swell. When a shoe fits, ot fits, when it doesn't, it doesnt. This shoe surprised the heck out of me because I don't remember the last time a size 9.5 sneaker felt like a 10.5. I can get away with the 9.5 because I've put a shoe insert in & I wear thick socks & the laces tie up very securely, which is another plus. My workouts are going just fine save for the stairmaster. I hate dealing with exchanges & returns so if I can make it work then I will, so thankfully, I could make due-but, I want others to know why the price discrepancy differences and what shoe size may work. If you are built bony like me but also have gunboats for feet, I would say go a full size down. Even me going to my usual 9.5, my lowest size, was barely doable, only so because I've got a good thick insole insert. If you have thicker feet, I'd say go half a size down because with this shoe it's not the width of the shoe that's the problem, the shoe cinches up & loosens great, it's the length of the shoe that's inaccurate. I still recommend this shoe, but I am a gym rat & go through sneakers like crazy so I'll get a new pair when I run through these, that's how much I love them. I hope this review helps and I hope I was detailed enough because it always bothers me when I don't know the body style of the person who is saying \"too big/too small, too tall/too short\", etc, because it does make a difference, for comparative purposes. It's for this lone reason that I give the shoe 4 stars instead of 5, because it was just too far off base. Hope this helps, everyone!",

(I actually tried the Boys X_PLR Boost Sneaker on in the big kids size at a shoe store, and they were very comfortable, but I would have needed a boys size 7 and they did not have it).These X_PLR Phase women's sneakers are not as cushy comfortable as the X_PLR Boost big kids version. The reviews stated they run large so I sized down: I normally wear 8.5 to 9 in women's shoes so I tried it in a size 8, which fit snug in the toes, but b/c these slant downwards from back to front then my foot was pushed downwards on the downward slant right into the toes, and the toes have rubber around the edge in the front which is hard, so it just pushed my toes downward into the front of the shoe,  and it was too tight in the toes, and then too loose in the heels on me.I felt ordering a half size up they would be too big.Also, I did not find that the cushioned soles on these were as cushiony as the X_PLR Boost big kids version, the 'Phase' seems less 'cushy' than the 'Boost'  X_PLR.As stated in other reviews,  the back of the heel is so-o-o big, and sticks out so far surrounding your heel, some said 'like clown shoes,' that I did not like the way this looked as well.So back these go, and still trying to find some women's sneakers that fit and are comfortable.",

She mentioned how incredibly comfortable they feel, even after wearing them all day at school and during playtime. The color combination was a big hit with her\u2014stylish and fun without being too loud. One of the best parts is how easy they are for her to slip on and off, which is great for busy mornings. No complaints about sore feet at the end of the day, which tells me they\u2019re made really well. Highly recommend for kids who are active and on their feet a lot",

They have laces but they are just to Snug the sneakers up and not really to hold them on your feet per se. In case you have not worn sneakers like this before you may be surprised to find out that the tongue is attached to the shoe so don't let that throw you if you're going to order these. They do fit nicely on the foot as long as you get your regular size so there's nothing to worry about. They're quite comfortable and fit like a dream in my opinion that's why I have three pairs of them now. And the price is certainly reasonable. I didn't pay more than $50 a pair for any of my three pairs of Swift run twos. And actually got one pair for $38 delivered free. So what's not to like? Comfortable attracted to deal with shoes under 50 bucks that I will get at least 3 years out of. I consider that to be a super cool volume shoes that fit good and look great. Highly recommended! One thing though I would say that these would be more suited to a casual shoe than possibly a serious running shoe. Not much of a heel counter here. But if you're looking for a cool shoe to wear with jeans this is the bomb.",

I have some Adidas Kaptirs as well and they support the heck out of your heels and arches, but these Run 22s are just like walking on a cloud all over. They don't exactly support separate areas, just pad your feet as a whole. I feel like I am walking on clouds! Even after 2 hours of treadmill at the gym, my feet still feel great.

        "review": "I love these so far.  First day with them.From what I can tell they are an Adidas entry into the lifestyle shoe trend and borrow styling from 1970's running and track shoes.  I certainly wouldn't run with these, but as a daily wear shoes they kind of speak to, yes, I was a decent if mediocre track runner years ago and I still weekend warrior run into middle age and am doing ok with it (albeit with a separate, dedicated set of shoes).  If you flip these over the soles have circles that to me evoke the sockets that you would screw your metal track spikes into.I tried on the Adidas SL 72 RS, a more true to original lifestyle form of a once popular track shoe.  Those are tighter and maybe fit more like a pair you would lace up to run track with in school. These are a bit looser fitting, so perhaps a bit better for a daily wear.What is present on both is a canvas vinyl type material that is perhaps true to the heritage.  However, some wearers seem to not like how the material does not bend and flex along the more pliable suede overlays.  To me it's just a characteristic, but it's there.  If you're curious about how it may look after you worn the shoes take a look at photos submitted by other reviewers.But me I love these!  Love the fit, the comfort, the vibe.  It's what I was looking for.",

So I was happy to find one that looked good and felt good.They are really light and breathable and fit true to size with a good amount of room in the toe box. The back of the heel makes them easy to put on and the laces seem to stay tied throughout the day.I'm going to keep an eye on some of the other colors to go on sale because $180 seems like a lot for a pair of shoes to me.

One disappointing part is the left shoe has a small piece of material on the inside at the front that is attached to the sole but is not attached at the top of it and my big toe touches it. It feels like a toe reinforcement that didn't get completely sewn in. For the price I paid, I'll put up with it.",

        "review": "I liked these shoes, so I ordered them going by the reviews thinking they would help me work a comfortable 10-hour shift but was sadly mistaken. Tried wearing them without an insole, and with two separate insoles with no look. The shoelaces are extremely too short for one, they rubbed the sides of my feet so badly that by the time I got home I had to elevate my feet cuz I could barely walk. I loosened the shoelaces hoping to give my foot more room but no matter how loose I made the shoelaces I was still left in extreme pain. Normally I do not wear a wide shoe, which is why I did not order a wide. Honestly I'm not even sure a wide would have fit me comfortably because the material up top is not very flexible at all. I even tried to wear them for two or three days before wearing them to work to break them in and it didn't help at all. After wearing them for one week, I'd had enough and decided to send them back. So if anyone does a job on their feet for 10 hours and does a lot of moving from left to right these are not the shoes for you. Unless you are a sucker for pain the only part of your foot that will not hurt is the heel of your foot. There's no proper arch support and not enough padding around the toes and ball of the feet, let alone toe room for an active person. I will be finding something else. This makes me leery of buying any other Adidas shoes.",

I was lookin for a pair of running shoes with more support so I thought trail running shoes might be the answer, however, I used them to run two 10K's on the pavement. I found the size to be accurate, and them to be very well build. However, in my opinion they don't have very good cushioning and are too tall. Hence I can't tie them down tight enough to hold in place while i'm running. So my feet slide around while running. This probably would not be a problem for trail runners who wear thicker socks, but in my case they were a waste of money.",

        "review": "I remember seeing these as a kid on my friend and some adults and thought to try them, I was a fan of Adidas as I loved the originals sneakers collection and one of my teachers had spoke about how the shoe felt like indoor cleats, I thought to finally try them.A great pair of shoes especially for the money, I probably wore these shoes over a thousand times too, to the point where there were holes and I had to get rid of them a few weeks ago. My first reaction when I got the shoes was that they were very light, at first you kind of have to break them in. They may seem a bit snug and may hurt a little bit. Perhaps it hurted me more than others because I have flat feet. After a week when you break them in, they sort of shape to your feet. It will feel comfortable and you'll feel as light as a feather, the shoes are great for athletics and they are very aesthetically pleasing, more so I liked how the shoe was rather versatile. If I wanted to wear some chinos, or some casual wear it wouldn't look to bad infact it would play the part. what I absolutely loved about these sneakers is how you can simply slip them on, I always hated those sneakers that you had to untie and worry about the shoe getting creases and what not. I however found that after a while, the shoe felt like it was slipping off and that it may have expanded during the time I was wearing, again nothing too big but it felt like it grew about 1/2 over the time I had it.  This became my go to shoe whenever I was leaving, I didn't even dare look at the others as my feet had gone through so much uncomfort when I went back. The shoe can get rather slippery in the winter and on wet areas so you need to be careful there but it's not like they're meant to be used during the winter. One of the things that I disliked about the shoe is how I had to keep on tying the laces several times, perhaps this had to with the laces mainly but I felt like it was the shoe moving from place to place as it started to expand and stretch. During the shoes last dying dies, I start to get holes from the ongoing times I've worn it, I knew it wouldn't last the way I treated it but for $40+ I didn't very much care. I later discovered that the inside of the shoes is composed of mainly some kind of cardboard, kind of surprising how such a comfortable fit could be made from such cheap material.I would recommend these to a friend, perhaps you may not want to wear them as much as I did however if you plan on making them last but it's great and with a price like that. You can't really go wrong. Would I buy them again however, there are many other shoes in the market and I'm willing to try many and see where they take me but I will have flashbacks of all the events that I had with my pair of shoes. I never begun to adore a shoe like that, no matter how much damage and dirt and stretching it went through, it managed and still had an amazing authentic look.",

        "review": "TL;DR: Great shoes, will mold to fit you like a glove, and last for at least a year of heavy use. Get the Samba Originals if you prefer a short tongue.About me: I'm on my fourth pair of Samba Classics. In a row. I love this shoe, and I think you will too. That being said, here's what I think you need to know:I first started wearing these shoes because I needed something with a flat sole to dance in (I did musicals in high school, and I wore straight through a pair of running shoes), and I fell completely in love with them. I wear them 100% of the time when it isn't raining and there isn't snow on the ground. I have also worn them for their \"intended purpose\" - indoor soccer - and find they work great there too.I would DEFINITELY recommend these shoes for serious walking, dancing, or indoor soccer. NOTE WELL: they will mold to your feet as if you were born wearing them, and will change their appearance somewhat once broken in (the leather will look a lot less shiny, and will develop a flatter fit across your foot), in my opinion much for the better. Like all leather shoes, these have a break in period, and I find it's less than a week. Once broken in, they feel AWESOME, and last a very long time: my last three pairs lasted between 1 year and 1.5 years each, depending on the amount of walking I did (walking increased when I went to college). They're also very comfortable walking / standing shoes. I've never gotten blisters or pains from them.I would NOT recommend these shoes for rain, snow, ice, hiking, or serious running. The flat sole, which makes them great for traction on flat, dry surfaces, falls short on all of these things. Since they are leather, they're fairly water resistant, and a coat of water repellent spray will make them very water resistant (and avoid winter salt water stains), but water WILL get in around the tongue, which is not attached at the sides, only at the front.These shoes tend to wear in two places: the interior heel (the back of the inside lining), which will develop holes if you're a fan of slipping your shoes on and off (which I don't recommend: these are leather, they're meant to be tied snug); and the sole, which will gradually wear toward smooth. I find that the sole and the upper wear at about the same rate: i.e. by the time the sole is worn to the point of noticeable slippage on wet surfaces, the shoes themselves look like they're ready to be replaced. If you don't care about these two factors (or you want a pair of old shoes to work in), they will basically last forever. I still use my first pair for construction, painting, and mowing the lawn. They're over four years old and the leather will probably outlast everything else in my life.These shoes are essentially identical to the Samba Originals, the difference being that these have a longer tongue. Some people don't like the tongue, which is reminiscent of soccer cleats, but I like it because it makes the shoes pop a bit more, and goes well with long casual pants, with which you can wear the tongue outside of the pants (the tongue is also not uncomfortable with shorts, especially after it gets bent forward a bit by being worn with long pants).",

        "review": "Honestly one of the best shoes on the market for wide foot people, if your looking to snag a simple set of running sneakers, in my opinion. Here's some in-depth info along with  pro's and con's:TLDR: Great quality shoes for the price, and easy to clean. Recommend to beginner and intermediate runners/hikers, experts may be willing to pay more money for increase of quality.PROs:- Perfect Fit. I usually wear 9.0 wide (USA), so that is what I ordered and it fit perfectly.- Comfort and Ease. I like how comfortable they are and they are easy to slip on and off (if you wish) by the use of the heel pull tab. The tab also prevents the heel from getting bunched in or broken when putting on the shoes, which was a frequent problem with some other brands I have owned in the past.- Easy to Clean, Quality Mesh. I have seen some reviews saying these shoes wear out easily or the mesh is easier to damage. YMMV but I didn't seem to have this issue and I've had these shoes for about a year. IMO I find the mesh to be much more durable than the cloth mesh most sports shoes have these days and much easier to clean, which is essential for anyone like myself, who often hikes or runs in forestry/mud.- Above Average Quality. As for the year timeframe, the 1st set was about 8 months of extreme use, then I purchased a 2nd pair which I've had for about 3 months now. This may seem like a short timeframe to some but for me, I usually have to change shoes every 6 months or less if they are lower quality because they get a lot of mileage and use. I still have the 1st set which I use as \"lawn mowing shoes\", as they are still usable but the tread does not get much grip/traction anymore for running. I liked them enough to buy that 2nd pair instead of some other brand/model.- Decent Arch Support and Sole Tread. You will find other shoes with the same or better, but I didn't see many that were this cheap in price.- Part of Amazon's \"Try Before You Buy\". Free try-ons. You can take up to 6 days to decide whether to keep/return if you wish, and only be charged if not returned by the 7th day. Day 1 is the day they are delivered.- Uniform in Color. The shoe currently comes in all-black or all-white, including the logo. YMMV but this is a pro for me due to work restrictions requiring all-black shoes, so I can also wear them leisurely at work if I choose (I'm a mechanic). Great for anyone with the same issue, or military, etc.CONs:- Not the most expert/elite quality shoe out there, but will definitely check most people's boxes for average needs, imo.- Cost is higher than one might desire for just simple leisure shoes. But as an avid runner, the price is about average. However, they are usually on sale. My 1st set was around 40% off which dropped it from $70-something to $43, which was worth it for me. 2nd set was about 20% off. Winter holiday seems to be the best time for sales price.- Tread pattern is smooth and circular, instead of rigid and square/triangle, in case that matters to you (in regards to rock climbing etc)Overall I was surprisingly satisfied with this shoe model personally, but your mileage may vary.",

I ordered multiple Brooks to try on and none was a truly good fit.I'm going to be doing a lot of walking, so I may purchase an additional insert but for everyday wear they are more than adequate without an insert.I'm happy to find a new brand, that has a dependable sizing system.Shoe quality:The quality appears to be goodArch support:arch support is goodMaterial thickness:SubstantialColor:blackSlip resistance:hopefully good I haven't been able to test drive in wet surfaces yetLightweight:yes, lightweight",

I broke a few toes 2 years ago and since then the toe area is too tight and hurts to walk, and I have very narrow feet so finding shoes are hard....most shoes that said wide toe box, the shoe itself was wide also. My daughter mentioned she wears Adidas and they are pretty roomy in the toe area. I read the reviews and someone else had mention this. So I bought a pair and they are like a dream on my feet! This pair is my second pair. I am able to walk long distances, stand on my feet in one place for hours, and ride my bike without hurting. Durable and Great Support all over. I purchased black and pink which are perfect for where I work as they wipe off easily. I haven't washed them yet, but I feel like they would withstand a trip in the washer. Only issue I have with them is where the tongue attaches to the area at the top of the laces (closest to the toes), I have to shove my finger in to smooth it out before tying or it's uncomfortable. Otherwise, these are my go to shoes going forward!",

The stitching used is obviously good quality, but is usually only seen if you lift the insert of the sneaker. But as stated before, there is no insert (imo) so now I\u2019m expected to buy an additional product to accommodate what I thought would naturally just be a part of a sneaker to be purchased by me, the consumer. I did not realize that the cloud comfort foam is not meant to be directly felt by my feet, but rather an insert that is not included with the sneakers themselves, and must be purchased individually (that doesn\u2019t even consider that \u201cthe right insert\u201d might be hard to find for any multitude of reasons $).",

Adidas seem to provide a modicum of arch support. Not much, but at least some. The shoes take a beating, plus washings, and still look new by the time grandkid has to size up. This is his most recent size up when he turned 5. He picked these because he liked the design and thought it looked cool.

I needed something lightweight, trail-ready, and supportive enough for hours of running, climbing, and wading through deep mud \u2014 and they delivered big time.I absolutely adore these shoes. They held up through 15K of mud, water, obstacles, and nonstop movement. I was knee-deep in 2.5 feet of mud for much of the race, and not once did they slip, rub, or make my feet ache. The tread was fantastic for trail grip, and the arch support was just as good as what I get from my Danskos or Brooks \u2014 which I wear daily at my hospital job where I\u2019m on my feet for 8+ hours.These didn\u2019t just survive the course \u2014 they thrived on it.

Dang I had to cancel the 7 and order the size 6. Reviews mention the shoe runs really big and to size down 1 or 1.5 sizes. The 5.5 was not available would have actually been perfect. The saving grace is that this shoe is not wide, so the narrow fitting allows me to wear with a bit more room in the toe.

From the moment I laced them up, I knew these shoes were going to be a game-changer, and they certainly proved their worth on the challenging trails.My primary requirements for hiking footwear are comfort and support, and these Adidas shoes delivered outstandingly on both fronts. The cushioning provides excellent comfort, absorbing the impact of each step, while the robust construction offers superior ankle and arch support, which is crucial for long days on the trail. One small note on sizing: I found that the sizing was a bit off, and I actually had to size down to get the perfect fit.I put these shoes through an extensive test, hiking between 8 and 11 miles each day through the rugged and rocky terrain of Estes Park. Despite the demanding conditions, my feet remained comfortable and well-protected. There was no slipping, rubbing, or discomfort, even after many hours of continuous use. The grip on the soles was exceptional, providing confidence on loose rocks and uneven surfaces.These shoes truly stood up to the challenge, proving to be incredibly durable and reliable. They not only protected my feet from the harsh ground but also contributed significantly to my overall enjoyment and stamina during the hikes.Overall, if you're planning a hiking adventure, especially one involving rocky or demanding trails, I cannot recommend these Adidas hiking shoes highly enough. They offer a perfect blend of comfort, support, and durability, making them an indispensable companion for any serious hiker.",

        "review": "Per many other reviews these shoes run really large. I normally wear an eight or an 8 1/2 in hiking and running shoes. The first pair I bought were eights which I thought would be small enough. They were huge. I returned those for a 7 1/2. I have wide feet and even the 7 1/2 is a smidge large. I ran out of time for a trip and kept them instead of trying an even smaller size. I have plenty of room in the toe box. I can\u2019t imagine these would work for anyone with narrow to maybe even moderately narrow feet. I also don\u2019t have much arch. I wear Hoka Gaviotas- if you have those you\u2019ll love these.  If you can find the right fit, these are very comfortable right out of the box and a great hiker. I hiked in Costa Rica in muddy and wet dirt and had zero issues. Grip and traction was great. There was no break-in needed-  no blisters or tired feet.  They cleaned up well. ( I do wish manufacturers would stop using white bottoms on hiking shoes. It\u2019s a given you\u2019ll be in brown dirt- why white?) I also wore these all day traveling and in airports. Seriously comfy shoe.  I wasn\u2019t a fan of the green color in the 8.5 - they looked a little garish. I wish all manufacturers had more neutral, natural colors.  I went to black in the second pair and much preferred that look albeit they\u2019re  a little boring. If you have feet like mine shoe shopping can be really frustrating. I went to REI and many other stores before giving up and going to Amazon. (Oddly I didn\u2019t find Hoka hikers comfortable. Too much arch) I do think it\u2019s worth trying to find the right size in these because in the end if you have wide flattish feet these are great for trails and even day to day. That\u2019s why I gave them 5 stars.One note- the rear pull strap is quite high.  While it didn\u2019t bother me a ton I can see how it might bother others.",

        "review": "These hiking shoes run larger than other brands, see my picture comparing them to several other brands I own that are the same size (size 8.) However, they are so comfy and my feet appreciated the extra room on my hike. My right foot typically can only stand a 45 minute hike before the ball of foot starts to throb and swell throbs. I took these out on a hour and 15 minute hike and only had mild pain. They performed very well on a variety of terrain. No slippage on sand, loose dirt, grass, or compact gravel, even in hills. There was minor slippage on loose rocksthat where about 1\"-2\" diameter when going downhill. The shoe also seemed to give my weak ankles more support. There was one point where I slipped slightly and felt my ankle wanted to turn, however the shoe prevented it. My old hiking shoes don't come up high enough on the ankle and my foot would have turned over for sure. If you're someone who has feet that ache and seem to swell when you hike, I would recommend sticking to your normal size. Otherwise you might want to size down. Personally, I'm glad they run a little big so my toes don't press against the shoe, which always seemed to happen when I'd walk down hills.

They were too big and I had to send back to get a 7. They are insanely comfortable and a perfect trail shoe when hiking boots are too much but tennis shoes aren\u2019t quite enough. These are more comfortable than typical trail running shoes and are a bit heavier. They have as good as or better traction and grip than other similar shoes (way more than OnClouds and about the same as Altra). They have a wide toe box and thick sole padding. They\u2019re a great hiking shoe or for walking off road or in mud and rain, as they\u2019re waterproof. Love them! They do look a little bulky on, so if that bothers you, you may want to look elsewhere.",

I have three other pairs of Adidas running shoes, two of them being 11's and one being 10.5. I also measured my heel to toe length and got between 10.5 and 11 inches, depending on if I am putting any weight on my foot or not. Based on this, I thought buying size 11 would be a safe bet. Once I put them on, I noticed the fabric above my big toe was a little tight when wearing them with socks on the thicker side, but not too uncomfortable. This may change as the insoles wear in. I was expecting there to be more room width-wise due to reviews stating that the shoes were very wide, but I did not find this to be the case. They seem to be on par with my other shoes, and I don't own any 'wide' sized shoes, but YMMV. If you are going purely off of the size chart, I would probably order a half to full size larger, but you can always return them and get another size. Overall, I like the shoes and will be ordering another pair, in size 11.5 this time, for when these wear out one day.",

Right out of the box, the shoes felt well made and durable, just as I'd expect from Adidas as I've owned lots of their shoes in the past. The design is sleek and sporty, with a slightly chunky, late 90s styled silhouette.The Cloudfoam cushioning is awesome, it feels like walking on a cloud, and helps me to be on my feet all day. The insoles have great contours and provide excellent arch support, which makes them comfortable for all-day wear. I even wore them on a long vacation with a lot of walking, and my feet felt great with no blisters. The shoes are also very lightweight while still offering solid support.The fit is true to size, but I did notice that they are a bit wider in the toe box, which is actually a plus for me. The lace up design allows for a more secure fit. While the toe guard felt a bit stiff at first, it broke in quickly and didn't cause any issues.Overall, these shoes are a perfect balance between comfort, performance, and everyday style.",

Very cute, and easily fits with many different outfits. We walked all day long, about 10 hrs each day. I was exhausted but my feet were happy!The outsole has nice curves to it, less impact but not too curvy like some sneakers are today.

I've always been able to count on them time and again to be well-made, with high quality fabrics and materials and this shoe is no different. They are lightweight, the insole is incredibly comfortable right out of the box. No break in time required. But for some reason, this style, the Astrastar is at least a half size to a full size larger than what I have always worn in an Adidas. I added some pics to compare to another Adidas I have that is also a size women's 9 1/2. So, though it's different for everybody, I would recommend sizing down in this style.

I walk in it and pretent it not that choked to my feet just because it so so beautiful.The outer sole is really bouncy and flexible, they soft and bend to your move. I love the sole.

They have a cushy EVA midsole and a rubber outsole that is more suited for urban wear than a typical soccer shoe, like the Samba. Arch support is good but not overdone. The Samoa's  are somewhat slept on in the Adidas Originals line, but are a fantastic shoe that pairs well with athletic or casual outfits and has clean, sleek lines.

To put them together in a sensible way costs extra for sure, that\u2019s a good value there.True, it doesn\u2019t fit as snugly as most other shoes we see, but counting on so many good and unique features of Avryn, it is a good model to have.Mine is the White/Zero Metallic.

I did research on good shoes for after the surgery and what is good to have, and for someone my age it mainly just seemed like having something with cushion and such that you didn't fall was most important.These shoes look great - I chose the black color as they're a bit more muted to suit my personal preference. These are wider with the soles which took a little bit of remeasuring to get used to when walking the first couple times, but then it was an afterthought. The cushioning is amazing! These are super comfortable. I've always been athletic until pretty much COVID, then the hip issue, and I've loved the Adidas brand, so have been perfect!These helped through the initial post-surgery steps, through physical therapy, through regaining my strength, and now with regular daily walking and whatnot.Definitely not waterproof, but perhaps waterproofing spray may help a bit. I live in the PNW so it rains when it's not the other season, but it hasn't bothered me yet.Bottom-line: Well-worth the purchase, definitely great for rehabilitation purposes, great for walking and stability.",

        "review": "This is my second pair of these shoes. I bought the first pair two years ago to take on a vacation to France and they were so good that this year I bought another pair, for you guessed it, another European vacation. What initially attracted me to these is that they are subtle yet comfortable. Yes, you can wear whatever shoes you want but in Europe, people tend to dress better, and their shoes are less flamboyant but still comfortable for hours and miles of walking. The purple is very subdued, and I have no problem wearing these just about anywhere. They're an ideal travel shoe because they are lightweight, breathable and supportive, all while being a fantastic value for the price. The name Ultrabounce conjures up thoughts of springy marshmallow comfort. I would say that's not entirely accurate. Yes, the shoes are comfortable but they are not crazy soft (like Hoka or some of the other super cushioned options out there)  and I think that's a good thing; they're cushioned enough to be comfortable but supportive enough to take care of your feet. What I also like about them is the way they fit. I have notoriously difficult feet to fit; I have narrow feet with high arches. While many companies are embracing the wider is better, especially in the toebox, these Adidas Ultrabounce runners have a welcomed medium to slightly narrow fit, perfect for me. In terms of size, I wear a size 12 in Nike and Asics; an 11.5 in Brooks and the 11.5 in these fit me perfectly. So why only 4 stars? I'm being picky, the insole is very basic and could do with more arch support; also, and this is a small thing, the laces are really long, they could be a little shorter. I worry that these will be discontinued, which would be a shame since they've become my go-to travel shoe and I bet that most people will appreciate them too. Buy them if you still can!",

Adidas actually made these in big sizes! I found no defects in the construction, or material of the shoes. The fit is very good, the ankle support is not there is you plan on using these for cross training. However when it comes to walking they are great. They are extremely light, I mean lighter than canvas sneakers while at the same time providing a lot more cushion. If you are not used to these types of walking shoes it does take a little bit of time to get used to. It literally feels like you are walking on a memory foam mattress at first. After a couple of days I started to break them in. They feel great on asphalt, concrete, gravel, and even some uneven terrain. The price was reasonable when compared to other walking shoes with similar padding and construction. If you want to take up walking I would recommend this pair.",

I don't know how long the bounce will hold up, but it is really nice to use these for walking or just wearing them all day.  The size is just right and they hug the foot well.  The only issue I have is that the rise on the back of the sneaker is just a bit too high for me.  When wearing no-show socks, the back of the sneaker rubs against the back of my foot and starts to get uncomfortable.  I am comparing these to a similar running show I have from Mizuno and I like the other one better due to the better shoelace design and lower rise on the back.

These are smaller feeling on his foot then his 5.5 old shoes. He also says they are narrow and squeeze his foot. He does not have wide feet, and we've not had that problem with shoes before. I do like the look of them on him, very cool on a eleven year old. They have a nice wide heel with good stability which is good since he has some pronation in his feet. Also he doesn't often wear sandals because of his pronation, so occasionally wears sneakers without socks in the summer. These are so scratchy inside that would not be comfortable with these. In the end these feel like a mid-quality shoe, but with good sole and support. The top feels a bit lower quality, and very scratchy.

        "review": "So I went down a rabbit hole to look for the PERFECT everyday sneaker and something that's robust and inexpensive as well. And let me tell you if you can find the right size for this shoe, it's well worth the hassle if the shoe FITS.Fit & Sizing:Now in terms of fit I unfortunately had to try THREE different sizing, to summarize- I'm normally a UK 9 (US9.5), and I saw reviews to size up but it was WAY too big for me, then ordered a size US9.5 which was OKAY, but I did the shove toes to the front of the toe box while seeing how many fingers I can put into the heel.. And it was 2 fingers (supposed to be 1 finger snugly). I tested it out walking for a whole day for about 4 miles walk and I didn't feel any fatigue from that. But the fit just felt a little off, that the heel still felt loose. I could still fit 2 fingers when doing that test. So finally I ordered a size US8.5 and YES it fits, BUT the joint above the toes (Metatarsal area) feels a little bit tight at the moment.I will update this review if it breaks in well and whether I was a lunatic to not stick with my true size. Will break in and update.Breathability:Shoes are fairly breathable. It is by no means a jogging shoe like running shoes but it's not suffocating. I'm hoping that this will be an all season shoe for me and this feels like a good balance  for this fall and hopefully the winter.Color:Ultimate dad shoe vibes- love the 90s classic aesthetic and texture (I got the Cloud White/Charcoal/Putty Grey), I'm happy this will pair with my minimalist outfits and I enjoy the simplicity of this colorway. If you're a uniqlo fan this shoe fits the bill pretty well with a lot of fits.Additional notes/Durability:Do note that I really went in the deep end to discover and research the perfect shoe not just for everyday use but also using this for occasional hikes too- because the sole is lugged (4.5mm) and it should be good for casual, occasional hikes. And also Adidas has a partnership with Continental I can attest from another a pair of Ultra Boost that these soles last a very long time. So it's amazing in terms of value- just behind VIBRAM but the shoes that have that technology tends to be a lot more expensive depending on model, around 100-200usd and above (like Hoka pricing). So I expect this shoe to last a long time.Conclusion:Don't sleep on this model, it's very underrated right now especially if it's on sale. Try it and be wary of the sizing problems. I'd say go for your true size and be prepared to go a size down, and disclaimer that everyone's feet is different.",

        "review": "I have narrow feet and heels usually have problems with shoes coming loose at the heel and ankle area. I purchased these based on some of the reviews that stated that these shoes ran small/narrow. The problem is that the elastic appearing band at the arch of the shoe is actually not elastic and appears to be more of a cosmetic touch. Even with my narrow feet, I had problems getting my foot into the shoe without a fair amount of effort assisted by a shoe horn. The band is relatively rigid and places a great deal of constriction in the midfoot area and along the inner arch of the foot. Once my foot is in the shoe, this constriction is very obvious and yet the heel/ankle area remain loose. This is a very non-anatomically sized shoe. The length appears to be true to fit, its just this midfoot band that is extremely uncomfortable. Also, the sole of this shoe is very stiff. It is not at all flexible unlike what you would normally expect in a casual slip on shoe. I was very disappointed as I liked the cosmetics of the shoe. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is one of the most uncomfortable shoes that I have ever purchased. I should have heeded the negative reviews that talked about how uncomfortable these shoes are. I just thought that it was because people had purchased the wrong size shoe. However, it is the construction and design of the shoe that makes it ill-fitting and uncomfortable. Perhaps that is why they are discounted so much. I have owned several pair of Adidas shoes (in the past they tended to fit well as they tended to accommodate narrower feet like mine). However, this is the first Adidas shoe style that I could not wear (in the proper 8.5 size) due to extreme discomfort. Again, quit a disappointment as I thought that I could snag a \u201cdeal\u201d as I really liked the sleek and clean look of the shoe. Will definitely be returning after just trying them on for 3-5 minutes.",

They are white, and slip on, but it gets pretty disappointing after that.The band on the side that is supposed to flex is more of a visual gimmick, which makes walking uncomfortable when it's combined with the shoe's unusual tight width.On the bright side- they'll stay clean for longer because I'll barely wear them. Realistically- I wish I had spent $10 more and gotten basic white shoes that I can wear without pain.",

Yes, it is true that whatever size you would wear( for example, I wear a women's size 7 and 1/2 so I knew to order a men's size 6) So yes, the reason that a lot of women are finding these running so big is because these are men's shoes! I will say this. They're super comfy and I actually even received him a day earlier was estimated. The quality is really good. The only real difference between the men's and women's is the toe box. As far as the height of it is a little roomier. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for some Adidas tennis shoes.

The padded collar gives serious ankle support, while the OrthoLite\u00ae sockliner molds perfectly to your foot and helps manage sweat. Even after full days of running and walking, my feet feel fresh and supported.\u2705 Reliable Build QualityThe synthetic leather upper is durable and wipes clean easily\u2014no peeling or fraying even after daily wear. The rubber cupsole balances firmness and flexibility, offering traction and durability all week long.\u2705 Versatile & Easy to StylePerfect for casual Fridays, weekend errands, or hitting the court.

I also bought a light grey pair a while back in a half size down (from a store, not amazon) and those fit the best of all 3 pairs I have. So overall, each color fits very differently and there is no consistency in quality. Very frustrating. They're super cute and I get compliments on them, but I won't buy adidas shoes again after this experience.Original review for black:When I first bought these I wasn't a fan. They were hard to put on without bending the back of the shoe, they weren't as comfy as my old cloudforms, and my usual size didn't fit. I am always a 9.5 in sneakers, but for these I had to return them and get a 10 because my toes were jammed in there. I got a shoe horn to help with puting them on, and that has saved me from a lot of pain. They are still comfy enough for every day wear, but I would not go walking miles in these. Even with these issues, I find myself wearing them often and choosing them over other tennis shoes because the material is high quality, the black color goes with everything, and they're super cute. Overall, I like them and bought another color, but I subtracted a star for the few issues I had to correct.",

Instead, it\u2019s made of elastic cool material that stretches when you insert your feet into them.  There\u2019s a flap that has laces like traditional shoes so you can further tighten them if it\u2019s still loose.  My daughter loves the fun girly color and says they\u2019re very comfortable.  The size runs slightly big so order down if your kids have smaller feet.Now for the not so good. The sole is more plasticky than grippy rubber.  I compare every shoes to Merrell since I consider them the benchmark.  Merrell use super soft grippy rubber soles.  In my opinion, it\u2019s not the best value for your money at $70.  Cross shop and consider Merrell as an alternative.",

        "review": "I ordered these Adidas Captor Flow 2.0 sneakers for my 10 year old niece knowing that school will be starting next month and she will want a new pair of sneakers. There are several color combos to order from and I debated about ordering the white with the fluorescent pink and yellow but white sneakers get so dirty and I knew they would be dirty in a week so I opted for the gray with purple combo.These sneakers are a tight knit, breathable mesh and the shoe is in one piece, no tongue, with man made leather eyestays with purple loops and tie laces. There is a high heel tab which makes putting them on a little easier although I have a pair of Adidas shoes with the high tab in the back and I needed to buy heel tab socks to prevent rubbing on the top of my heel, she wear ankle socks so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. There is also a heel reinforcement as well as an extra rubber tab at the toes although she is rough on sneakers so I am not sure these will help. The inner sole is their patented Cloudfoam for cushioning and these shoes have a decent arch as well. The sole is white with a touch of purple to match the shoes and it\u2019s constructed of the typical foam soles you find in most sneakers these days, it feels hollow but it\u2019s a lightweight synthetic foam rubber.These shoes are nicely constructed and my niece really likes the style of this shoe, it\u2019s current and she even likes the grey and purple color combo  (she usually almost always picks out pink!). The price point is about average for brand name kids sneakers but these Kaptir Flow 2.0 sneakers are nice quality and my niece said they are super comfortable so the price is a good value. Overall, she gave them two thumbs up!",

She fell in love with the black and purple color combo (her two favorite colors!), and I love that the colors are not only pretty but also practical\u2014dirt and scuffs don\u2019t show easily.What makes these shoes stand out is the ease of use. Tying laces can be frustrating for my daughter on most days, and these slip-ons have been a game-changer. She can put them on independently, which gives her a boost of confidence and saves us all time and stress.As a parent, I was initially concerned about safety and grip, but these sneakers have great traction. The material is easy to clean, and even after a year of daily wear, they still look and perform great. Most importantly, they\u2019re comfortable enough for all-day use\u2014no complaints about foot pain, even with her low tone.The price point (around $50) is very reasonable for the quality. Honestly, I\u2019m just so happy to have found a stylish, functional, and budget-friendly shoe that works for her needs. I highly recommend for other parents navigating similar challenges.",

I got these for $65, which is a good price.  The colors look just like pictured online, and the bubblegum pink with the neon yellow/tennis ball green looks very cool and unique.

I can adjust the fit with the ample laces to accommodate mild swelling or a slightly thicker sock when needed. The padding of the foot bed is engineered for comfort and did not disappoint me. They also provide excellent stability and maneuverability as I can mildly feel contact with the ground. Some say there is not enough cushion in the foot bed but I found them to be a perfect walking shoe with all day comfort. This popular style matches almost any type of casual dress and I even wore them in the gym.  They aren\u2019t bulky and pack well so they are also a great travel shoe.

The coloration is great on these and they fit very well (although we ordered a size up for our son so he will grow into them.  They seem to be a great color that won't get too dirty too quickly, and can be washed easily.  They have nice padding to them as well which is great for running around and helping him.  I would say these are a great priced sneaker for your child, especially with the Marvel theme that they have going for them, which is awesome considering how inexpensive they are.  They come with a strap too so he doesn't have to tie them every time which makes it easy to get out the door.  Overall, the quality of these shoes is great and I would recommend them for anyone!",

The elastic laces and hook-and-loop strap make them super easy for him to put on and take off by himself, which is perfect for busy mornings.The fit is true to size, snug but not tight, and the cushioned EVA midsole provides lightweight support that absorbs impact, keeping his feet comfortable even after hours of running and playing. The rubber outsole is non-marking and grippy, making them safe for indoor and outdoor use.What I really appreciate is the quality and durability\u2014these sneakers feel well-made, and even after several weeks of daily wear, they still look and feel like new. The bright colors are fun and appealing, and they\u2019ve held up through playground adventures, running around, and casual wear. Overall, these sneakers are comfortable, durable, easy to wear, and perfect for an active child.",

They are a snug fit compared to Keen. There's quite some height added for shock absorption, which surprised him at first, but it adds to the comfort. There's good arch support and the quality is great. At 42 USD, these seem like a regular price for boys' sneakers with this level of arch support and durability. These are much easier than lace up shoes and just a bit more effort than Skechers slip-ins.",

She is able to easily put them on herself and found them to be comfortable.The reason form my three star rating is that they don't wear very long, they wind up looking very rough, after minimal wears (~10-15).  The construction is solid, but the fabric around the toe is like a felt, different than overall body and seems to get messy, discolored and pilling quickly.  I would recommend these shoes, but perhaps NOT in a lighter color.By the way - let's not label a shoe as \"boys\" just because it's blue.",

A lot of shoes are uncomfortable for me because my arches are low but these still feel good after an hour chasing my little one around the playground.I really like how the top of the tongue is cut so it doesn't press against my ankle, that really adds to the comfort.For kids, I prefer a wider toe box to make room for developing feet.

They\u2019re also incredibly lightweight, so my child runs around effortlessly. Most importantly, these shoes are durable and hold up to the normal wear and tear that comes with a toddler\u2019s active lifestyle.Cleaning them is a breeze\u2014they\u2019re easy to wash and air dry. I do recommend removing the insoles before air drying for best results. One important tip: avoid heat drying in the dryer as the plastic components can melt.The price point is surprisingly affordable, especially compared to similar options in stores. Overall, these shoes are a fantastic buy, and I highly recommend them for any parent with a busy toddler!",

The actual shoe underneath the fabric still seems to be holding up ok, so I guess more of a cosmetic issue, but still annoying.

Adidas should be ashamed to make people burn money and contribute that level of waste to the environment. We will no longer purchase anything from Adidas.",

The stitching and all of other things that went into the actual production of the shoes seem durable at this point. The reason behind me only giving four stars is the packaging and/or delivery. I dont get packages at my residence because of problems with package theft so anything besides usps mail I have shipped to the CVS Pharmacy across the street and pick it up with my ID. Usually its perfectly fine, which leads me to believe this was a shipping problem. When I got the shoes home and opened the bubble wrap \"envelope\", which was already opened half way, the adidas box was demolished. My first thought was, \"oh no, my shoes are probably in shredded pieces\". The box literally fell in parts to the floor taking one shoe with it. I thought there would be absolutely no way the shoes made it in that box with no damage or stuff marks.Buuuut they did! Not a single scuff mark, dirty spot, frayed thread, or anything. The shoes were in 100% perfect condition. Im absolutely thrilled with these shoes. And the flash sale made them an unbeatable price! Thanks, Amazon and Adidas!",
