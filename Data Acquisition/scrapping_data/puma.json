The fit receives mixed feedback - while some say it's fantastic, others find them too narrow at the toe. Durability is also mixed, with some saying they'll last a long time while others report them breaking down quickly on the insole.

Also, the section in the heel that appears to be clear or otherwise translucent is actually solid black. Otherwise a good purchase, but maybe a little expensive for what they are. Incidentally, I have found some truly amazing articles of clothing on Amazon over the years, but lately a lot of what I have received has looked drastically different than what was pictured, often with the same listings on the site for years with no updates as presumably the products change. But I digress. In short, these Pumas have good arch support, are very comfortable, and feel good for picking up the pace on what little working out I do. Buy them, especially if you catch them for a particularly low price.",

This is a very comfortable shoe with a Gel insert, so your steps are pretty cushioned and light. H O W E V E R, THERE ARE TOE-HOLES ON MY SHOES NOW!  To get an idea of the usage for wear and tear, I've used these shoes at the gym 5 days a week for 1.5 hrs for only the past 6 weeks - with only 25 minutes of that being cardio. I do not use these shoes for any other purpose.  I'm upset because these shoes wore out already! I'm not sure what type of resistance sneakers should withstand, but I can tell you that today I have shin splints (which I believe is because the insert has worn down) and I just noticed these toe holes!  For the record, I'm well groom with mani-pedi's so my toenail did not bust open this shoe!If you need this for the gym I do not suggest it unless you are ok with the life span and maybe alternate shoes.  However, if you just want a comfortable, cute set of kicks to hang out it, then you should show these guys off :)I get a lot of compliments!",

I will say that I\u2019m used to wearing cowboy boots and had to stop wearing them all the time due to medical reasons. But I am used to leather and leather-like items. But if you are not, these might feel warm if you wear them on a hot day. They have some airflow but they definitely aren\u2019t like a running shoe for air flow. Cowboy boots allow no air flow so I\u2019m used to it and I don\u2019t have a complaint about it. They also have a strong leather smell when they are new, which is not my favorite smell but I\u2019m used to it with cowboy boots again. But if you don\u2019t like the smell of leather it might be overpowering at first. Overall nice shoes that are comfortable and look nice that I wear everywhere I go now. They fit well and don\u2019t seem to untie themselves constantly like some shoes seem to. I wear them in wet grass all the time and they are waterproof in short grass. They have breathing holes across the top so if you step in a puddle that is over your shoe it will likely fill from the top and then you would have to take it off and actually dump it.

I've found them to be an excellent all-around shoe that provides comfort, style, and solid performance without a hefty price tag.\u200bThe \"Softride\" foam is the real star of the show here. The cushioning is incredibly comfortable right out of the box and provides a plush, responsive feel whether I'm walking, doing light jogging, or working out. It's a noticeable upgrade from many other shoes in this price range. The support and stability are also great for cross-training. The TPU cage gives you a locked-down feel, and the zoned rubber outsole provides reliable traction on a variety of surfaces, from gym floors to pavement.\u200bBeyond the performance, they simply look great. The sleek design and clean lines make them versatile enough to wear not just for the gym but also for casual everyday use. The fact that PUMA uses at least 30% recycled materials in the upper is a nice bonus and something I appreciate as a consumer.\u200bThe long-lasting comfort is why I keep coming back to this model. My first pair held up incredibly well to daily use, and I expect the same from this one. If you're looking for a shoe that's comfortable for all-day wear, performs well during a workout, and doesn't break the bank, the PUMA Softride Enzo 5 is a perfect choice. Highly recommended.",

I was and still am pleasantly surprised by what feels like a shoe that will hold up for the next 6 to 12 months at minimum as I put them through their paces ... not necessarily with what I had originally planned (trail hiking and running), but more so everyday life (work and play). I've tried some of the highest rated and more expensive shoes.  From a beginner running (9.5 min mile) standpoint and a person who tries to eat right and exercise everyday I would say that these shoes are a perfect fit for anybody's everyday activities. I work long 12-hour shifts and I'm constantly on my feet.  These shoes stood up to the time duration and did not cause my feet any discomfort.  They have just the right amount of padding, firmness and stability so that you feel confident with every step you take.  Granted I did not test these shoes in wet environments on varying surfaces (specifically smooth).  These shoes are said to be waterproof however I would probably caution people with regard to that and just say water resistant.  This is my first pair of Pumas and I am truly impressed.  For treadmill running I have a pair of Adizero Evos which are also fantastic but seem to be more environmentally limited due to their lack of semi cleated soles for outdoor running.  I'd highly recommend these Pumas as an everyday shoe.  They have served me well in varying environments including the rough sidewalks/streets of Tijuana MX.",

I need to wear thin socks, rather than thick athletic type socks. They are holding up great and I am able to wear them for full shifts and more with no pain.

The top is kind of narrow and does not spread sideways to allow the foot to get in without a lot of effort.  2nd problem, getting out of them, was even worse.  I got one foot out with extreme effort, took about 5 minutes, the other foot i actually had to cut slits to allow that part of the shoe to spread enough to pull my foot out.  That was after about 15 minutes of effort, no exaggeration.  Even tried using the shoe horn to try to get the foot out but that didn't work.  I hope the slits work as i'd hate to have to chuck them, or maybe donate them, after only 1 use.  I've already got a pair of slip ons in my cart for my next order.",

The pressure is unbearable. There is also a defect in the right shoe, where a piece of fabric presses into the toenail of the big toe.

Here\u2019s my honest experience:Clean, classic designThe Caven 2.0 features a sleek, retro-inspired silhouette that pairs easily with jeans, joggers, or casual shorts. The minimalist style works for both casual outings and everyday wear.Comfortable cushioningThe padded insole and soft lining provide excellent comfort for all-day use. Whether walking around the city or running errands, my feet stayed comfortable and supported.Durable constructionThe upper materials feel sturdy and well-made. The outsole offers good traction and grip on a variety of surfaces, adding to the overall durability.Versatile color optionsThe neutral tones and simple design make them easy to match with different outfits. They\u2019re a reliable go-to sneaker for any wardrobe.Lightweight feelDespite their sturdy build, these sneakers are surprisingly lightweight, reducing foot fatigue over long periods.Sizing runs slightly narrowIf you have wider feet, you may want to size up or try them on first for the best fit.Break-in periodThe leather-like material may feel a bit stiff initially. After a couple of wears, the sneakers soften and become more flexible.Not for high-performance sportsWhile great for everyday wear and light activity, these sneakers are designed more for lifestyle use than intense athletic performance.",

Regardless they came in the original box and packaging and in the correct size and color so all is well and they are his favorite shoes! Sizing is true to size for other sneakers (except Nike because you have to size up in those). The quality is that of all Puma branded items in my opinion and excellent in craftsmanship and comfort.

I usually kow within a few steps if they are going to work or not. These by far are the most comfortable and great feeling and riding shoe that I own. Amazing to run in and they are more comfortable than any running shoe I have ever owned. If I had to pick just one shoe this would be the one. Great lockdown and unbelievable ride and no overlays over the toes to press or rub. All the reviews I watched and read on these shoes are spot on. Maybe not the best looking ones out there but I'd buy them again in a heartbeat. They beat out my Saucony triumph 20, my Ascis novablast 3 and my New Balance 880 v12 which are all phenomenal in my opinion. Guess I got a lot of running to do!...lol",

During the past few years I've worn out Nikes and in recent months tried out couple pair of Adidas and Pumas and a pair of Under Armour but none were good for one reason or another. After some research, excluding Nike that I no longer care to patronize, I ordered this pair of Pumas and a pair of Adidas.  Both had very good reviews by credible sources. After trying on both I went with these and have worn while walking the past couple weeks. They've been very comfortable and supportive and appear to be wearing very well even with the daily 2.5 miles on pavement. Actually I've noticed some discomfort on a few walks but believe it was due to lacing a little too tightly. Bottom line, I've pleased enough and think with continued wear these shoes and my feet will acclimate. I'd go 4-to-5 star if possible but rounding up optimistically.",

They\u2019re super lightweight but still offer great stability, which is key for all the lateral movements and strength exercises. They feel really secure during sled pushes, jumps, and runs, and I never feel weighed down.The fit is comfortable, and they\u2019ve held up well with regular training.

Planning to purchase more in other colors, once they go on sale.  It's a minor thing, but I really like the patterning of the rubber on the bottom; has almost a octopus sucker look to them.  It's the small details that can really make a difference.  I used to love the Saucony Original Jazz shoes, but they changed their sizing, and cut back on production.  These are a solid replacement.",

These shoes have quickly become my favorite pair for everyday wear and light workouts.Firstly, the design is sleek and modern. The Pacer Future sneakers have a streamlined silhouette that looks great with both athletic wear and casual outfits. The combination of mesh and synthetic overlays provides a lightweight feel while ensuring durability and support.Comfort is another standout feature of these shoes. The soft foam midsole offers excellent cushioning, making every step feel comfortable and springy. Whether I\u2019m walking around town or spending time at the gym, my feet feel supported and well-cushioned.The sneakers also offer good breathability, which helps keep my feet cool and dry, even during longer wear periods. This is particularly important for active days or warmer weather.Additionally, I appreciate the affordability of the PUMA Pacer Future sneakers. They provide excellent value for money without compromising on quality or style.Overall, I am highly satisfied with the PUMA Men\u2019s Pacer Future sneakers. They combine style, comfort, and affordability in one package, making them a great choice for anyone looking for versatile athletic shoes. I would recommend them to anyone seeking a reliable and stylish footwear option for everyday use.",

So a lot of time to test these out and break them in.The overall shoe is good. They play good, feel good, and look good.Because of the material they're durable and breathable. The memory foam insoles are really comfortable and my feet don't feel sore after wearing them for long periods of time. I've noticed no signs of wear, also my feet stay cool and don't feel like a swamp.The only problems I have with the shoes is that they are tight to put on and tight while wearing. They are true size to your foot so my feet have room to move around. Which is why I find it weird that they feel tight around my feet. Not unbearably tight though.If your looking for a good looking shoe thats durable and comfortable that also don't break the bank these are a good choice.Pros:-comfortable-durable-breathableCons:-tight to put on-tight when wearing",

        "review": "I just received these Puma Redon Bungee shoes today and they're exactly what I was looking for.Let me begin by debunking a few of the misconceptions about this shoe you'll find in other reviews here.  Apparently more than a few people did NOT realize what they were buying.  I saw complaints about the thin midsoles being uncomfortable to walk in all day.  Umm yeah, they weren't designed for walking.  And someone was complaining about the lack of arch support.  Once again, that is intentional.  This wasn't designed as a running shoe or a trainer.This is designed as a driving shoe.  It minimizes bulk.  So no bloated padded midsole like running shoes.  And outsole wear is not really a top priority so, the rubber outsole is thin too.  Also the sole is flat with zero heel drop unlike most running shoes.  And there is basically zero arch support on purpose.The reason for taking out all those \"features\" is to make a shoe that fits like a second skin.  Light, tightly fitted to your foot with no excess bulk to give you maximum space around the clutch, brake, and gas pedals in the car's footwell.  And that thin, flat midsole and outsole is designed to give you maximum feel of the pedals under your foot.  The rubber outsole is curved up the heel of the shoe for a reason, to prevent slip in your right foot when you are trying to heel and toe downshift a manual transmission.Can you wear these to walk from the car to a restaurant?  Sure.  Do you want to wear them to walk all day or for a 7 mile run?  No way.  These are a specialty shoe.  They are great on long drives.Puma sells to motorsports unlike most sneaker brands.  They have at least 3 other motorsports shoe lines, the Speed Cat, Drift Cat, and Future Cat.  But the Redon is the only one (I think) to offer a slip on bungee lace design.  I'm used to leather driving loafers for the street but those don't really look right with jeans or shorts.  So, I bought the Redon's as a casual driving shoe with the same slip on convenience a my leather driving loafers.  And truth be told, I'll use them as my house slippers too because they are easy to slide into or pop off.Another thing that may confuse people is that Puma also makes shoes for martial arts fighting on mats.  The Redon has a much of the same look as their fighting shoes.  Minimal bulk, skin tight fit, flat soles, rubber on the outside of the heel, light weight.  So it looks a lot like a fighting shoe which is another highly specialized product.So the Redon is not your usual casual sneaker or a running shoe.  But it's a really nice driving shoe that can be worn to walk a few blocks with no problem.  I like the clean minimalist look a lot.  I like the light weight.  I love the slip on feature.  And I love the thin sole that gives me great \"feel\" of what's under my foot.Another complaint I've seen here is the fit.  I wear a size 11D (medium width) in a running shoe so that's what I bought in the Redon Bungee.  They fit me fine in both length and width.  I didn't need to size up or down.  They are snug but easy to step into.  They feel secure on my feet but not so tight that they're annoying or painful.  But I'd advise anyone with wide feet to think twice about these.  They are made snug to work with the bungee lacing system.So all in all, I'm really happy with these driving shoes for the street.  At $40 they're a great value.  I may ditch leather driving moccasins altogether.",

I contacted Puma because I wanted to return them and have a replacement pair sent, but they informed me they had \"determined that there is no defect with this specific product that would qualify for a refund or reship.\" When I initially contacted them, they replied on October 22nd saying they would get back to me in 7-10 business days. They actually made me wait three full weeks (or 15 business days) before responding tonight (November 12th). All in all, this has been terrible customer service.As a big fan of Puma footwear (Speedcats in particular), and having worn nothing but them for the past decade, this experience has made me rethink my brand loyalty.I cannot recommend this shoe or brand in good faith to anyone.",

The minimalist style works for both casual outings and everyday wear.Comfortable cushioningThe padded insole and soft lining provide excellent comfort for all-day use. Whether walking around the city or running errands, my feet stayed comfortable and supported.Durable constructionThe upper materials feel sturdy and well-made. The outsole offers good traction and grip on a variety of surfaces, adding to the overall durability.Versatile color optionsThe neutral tones and simple design make them easy to match with different outfits. They\u2019re a reliable go-to sneaker for any wardrobe.Lightweight feelDespite their sturdy build, these sneakers are surprisingly lightweight, reducing foot fatigue over long periods.Sizing runs slightly narrowIf you have wider feet, you may want to size up or try them on first for the best fit.Break-in periodThe leather-like material may feel a bit stiff initially. After a couple of wears, the sneakers soften and become more flexible.Not for high-performance sportsWhile great for everyday wear and light activity, these sneakers are designed more for lifestyle use than intense athletic performance.",

I tried to find them in stores everywhere an could not find this color combo so ended up buying on amazon even though my prime membership delivery didn't matter and I still had to pay for shipping. Regardless they came in the original box and packaging and in the correct size and color so all is well and they are his favorite shoes! Sizing is true to size for other sneakers (except Nike because you have to size up in those). The quality is that of all Puma branded items in my opinion and excellent in craftsmanship and comfort. He wears them all day almost every day of the week! They were a great price and definitely on trend for this school year!",

        "review": "Honestly one of the best shoes on the market for wide foot people, if your looking to snag a simple set of running sneakers, in my opinion. Here's some in-depth info along with  pro's and con's:TLDR: Great quality shoes for the price, and easy to clean. Recommend to beginner and intermediate runners/hikers, experts may be willing to pay more money for increase of quality.PROs:- Perfect Fit. I usually wear 9.0 wide (USA), so that is what I ordered and it fit perfectly.- Comfort and Ease. I like how comfortable they are and they are easy to slip on and off (if you wish) by the use of the heel pull tab. The tab also prevents the heel from getting bunched in or broken when putting on the shoes, which was a frequent problem with some other brands I have owned in the past.- Easy to Clean, Quality Mesh. I have seen some reviews saying these shoes wear out easily or the mesh is easier to damage. YMMV but I didn't seem to have this issue and I've had these shoes for about a year. IMO I find the mesh to be much more durable than the cloth mesh most sports shoes have these days and much easier to clean, which is essential for anyone like myself, who often hikes or runs in forestry/mud.- Above Average Quality. As for the year timeframe, the 1st set was about 8 months of extreme use, then I purchased a 2nd pair which I've had for about 3 months now. This may seem like a short timeframe to some but for me, I usually have to change shoes every 6 months or less if they are lower quality because they get a lot of mileage and use. I still have the 1st set which I use as \"lawn mowing shoes\", as they are still usable but the tread does not get much grip/traction anymore for running. I liked them enough to buy that 2nd pair instead of some other brand/model.- Decent Arch Support and Sole Tread. You will find other shoes with the same or better, but I didn't see many that were this cheap in price.- Part of Amazon's \"Try Before You Buy\". Free try-ons. You can take up to 6 days to decide whether to keep/return if you wish, and only be charged if not returned by the 7th day. Day 1 is the day they are delivered.- Uniform in Color. The shoe currently comes in all-black or all-white, including the logo. YMMV but this is a pro for me due to work restrictions requiring all-black shoes, so I can also wear them leisurely at work if I choose (I'm a mechanic). Great for anyone with the same issue, or military, etc.CONs:- Not the most expert/elite quality shoe out there, but will definitely check most people's boxes for average needs, imo.- Cost is higher than one might desire for just simple leisure shoes. But as an avid runner, the price is about average. However, they are usually on sale. My 1st set was around 40% off which dropped it from $70-something to $43, which was worth it for me. 2nd set was about 20% off. Winter holiday seems to be the best time for sales price.- Tread pattern is smooth and circular, instead of rigid and square/triangle, in case that matters to you (in regards to rock climbing etc)Overall I was surprisingly satisfied with this shoe model personally, but your mileage may vary.",

I ordered multiple Brooks to try on and none was a truly good fit.I'm going to be doing a lot of walking, so I may purchase an additional insert but for everyday wear they are more than adequate without an insert.I'm happy to find a new brand, that has a dependable sizing system.Shoe quality:The quality appears to be goodArch support:arch support is goodMaterial thickness:SubstantialColor:blackSlip resistance:hopefully good I haven't been able to test drive in wet surfaces yetLightweight:yes, lightweight",

Especially when running or doing a strength move that requires me to firmly plant my feet.

It seems pretty durable as I haven't noticed any significant wear at this point. The stack height is definitely on the smaller side but it is very lightweight, making it great for workouts and racing. I personally wouldn't use this shoe for long runs or on rocky surfaces because it doesn't have much forefoot cushion (though the heel cushion is better), but I think it would work for pretty much anything else. Also, it's hard to beat this shoe price-wise. I got it for $45 and am considering buying a couple more!",

The leather upper gives them a premium look, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. They work perfectly as lifestyle shoes and are great for running errands, light strolling, or just pairing with a laid-back outfit.However, do not buy these for running or high-impact activities. They\u2019re quite heavy and have an extremely soft, squishy sole that offers little to no responsiveness or support for running.

They were extremely popular in the late 70's and early 80's.  The design, fit and quality were really good.  But, somehow, they simply stopped making a great shoe, and the ones after the above time period were poor quality, looked cheap, were cheap, and ugly.  Not made nor designed for a man; more or less for a teenager and someone in their early 20's.  It was hard to find a classic Puma.  After searching, I did.They arrived today.  Perfect fit, comfortable, and a good-looking sleek, black pair of sneakers.I didn't buy these to rock climb, go jogging or for hiking etc.  I bought these for a casual sneaker: go to the gym, wear around sneaker.  Concerning the durability, I will have to wait and see.  If they last a few years, then I will be fine with that.  I suspect they will last longer because I have other sneakers for other type of wear.If you want a classic, clean looking, black pair of leather sneakers, with all the above I described, consider these.By the way, the size was perfect.",

These PUMAS are very comfortable, with good support for your feet without having to feel as if you're wearing flip flops.  These  fit TRUE TO SIZE - for example, if you normally wear size 10, these will fit true to whatever size you normally wear; you will NOT need a larger size than you normally wear.  These are very comfortable, while also STYLISH and PUMA did  NOT disappoint- with THIS  particular style.  I would certainly recommend getting a second pair.",

I'm not sure of the type suede they are made of but it wears hard resists water and bleeding and cleans up nicely.These shoes have been around for decades , back when the tennis shoe was sold and made for playing tennis. Now they are much of a statement of your style as they are their utility.From gangsters to Lady Gaga This puma classic looks as good with the Mobsters velor tracksuit to a faded pair of Levi 501s on Sunday mornings.Construction Wise it's a lot of shoe for the money they wear hard and long. the soles are non-marring, the uppers glued and stitched. The matching color laces laces are extra wide and probably will last as long as the shoe itself, mine came with a pair of extra white laces should you not like the colored laces that they are shipped with.i wear a size 13 shoe , all Nikes are too narrow for me and some others such as Skechers are sometimes too wide this Puma seems true to size in this form.I have had a pair of the non classic leather tennis shoes that were a little bit narrow and constricted at the toe.In all fairness these fit perfect. Priced Right at $60 delivered on Amazon prime they come in several colors I'm sure you'll be pleased with whatever you choose,  so if you're on the fence get them you won't regret it.Warm regardsy Jerry and Honeycutt Jr.",

        "review": "I hate buying a pair of sneakers online that seem like such a great bargain, then they come in the mail and seem stiff, without any comfortable padding, and they just seem like terrible knock offs. I mean, the inside bottom sole isn't cushioned at all, and the sides walls of the sneaker aren't soft or cushioned at all either. Then it hits you, this is why these sneakers were cheap. BUT...these Pumas are not those cheaply made ones. The look great, they are truly classic Puma suede, and feel awesome on my feet. They are soft and padded nicely on the inside around the ankle and on the sole. As I stated in the headline, for $29.99, I should have bought multiple pairs! I love the grey/white look. I was watching these last year, and they dropped from $60 to $39. I wanted to purchase them last year, but didn't, and I was heart broken to see later that the price jumped back up to $60. My wife and I were sitting on the couch before this past Christmas, and she pointed out to me, \"aren't these the sneakers you were looking at awhile ago?\" She pointed out the incredible $29.99 price drop, and I \"clicked to buy\" immediately! If they offer them in other colors, still at that price, I might just get more!  In case you are wondering, I highly recommend these to any Puma lover, or anyone who loves great sneakers.  **Please note, I marked that these fit as expected. They fit as expected for a Puma sneaker. I have wide D sized foot. Pumas run a wee bit on the narrow side. These still fit great though**",

Just arrived I wore it to test if they fit well and as soon as I put my foot into the shoe, automatically was drawn a line on it. The design doesn\u2019t have good finished, as I said they look like fake non-original Puma shoes, I think they are not real leather. The size was correct and they fit well on my feet. If you wanna take the chance for $30,00\u2026 is up to you but I don\u2019t recommend to buy them, I think they won\u2019t last long",

        "review": "Early review:  They arrived last night in a plastic bag not marked with a string or label like most new shoes.They are nice looking and I love the material. I work on my feet and have a spur on my heel that irritates my achilleas. I need a show with a raised heel but also extreme comfort to the soles. Recently a ganglion cyst formed on the top of my foot. It goes down when I am not wearing my comfortable but boxy Clogs work shoes.I needed something to match the comfort of my expensive Clogs but soft enough not to irritate the cyst on the top of my feet that was rubbing against the rubber rib eight hours a day. The price was a fourth of the price of the average professional work shoe.The Shoe came with a terrible insert and I changed them at once. They were lumpy, thin foam. The shoe fits snug around the toes but like a sock to the top of your feet. If you want to wear socks go up a half to a whole size.They fit and feel like wearing swimming socks with thick rubber soles of a running shoe.I wore them out for a few hours and decided thin socks would be needed due to sweaty feet without socks. One review said they were over hot. I did not find them so. A few reviews said they cramped the toes  and it was true at first, but not too bad. A co worker purchased the same shoes said she found the toes cramped but they took form later and is not longer an issue.I am on my feet for 8 hours straight and  10-18k steps a shift. Comfort is required. After my first night wearing them I love them. My toes were a bit tight at first but not too much. I never felt discomfort. I love the lift and the running shoes soles. It is like having the best of both worlds in socks across the top and strong soles together with a pleasant look. I strongly recommend these shoes and have to my co workers.On an extra note after a few days of wearing the shoes, the toes no longer feel tight.  I will be buying more colors to wear casually in place of my other tennis shoes.",

They did look new though so i unwrapped and WOW!  When I put them on, I didnt take them off until I went to bed.  They were so incredibly comfortable.  I have very fussy feet and so it\u2019s often times hard to find comfortable shoes for being on my feet or walking for long distances or several hours.  These are very light weight and should keep my feet cool enough in the  summer heat.  Since they do not have lacees, i wondered if my feet would be secure enough and stay in place, and they do.  My right foot pronates inward and this shoe seems to have the right support to keep my feet well aligned.  I highly recommend,",

They are hard to get on.  The sole thickening is 2.1 inch at the heel which makes it difficult to slip you heel in with having to tug on the back to pull them in position.  I don't mind because once they are on, they feel good and comfortable.  I wear them without socks all day with no discomfort.  They are very easy to get off.I wash mine after every use by removing the inner cushion and tossing them in the washer.  I place them outside to dry.  I have tried many of the other slip on walking shoes and for the price, I like these the best.",

        "review": "I was excited to get some slip-on shoes since Sketchers decided to stop making their VERY nice Leather slip-on shoes. When I received these new shoes I ordered 3 of them since my size sells out fast. Two of the pairs this one was only in a plastic bag no shoe box. I was told they would be received all together in one order, NOPE; one pair came one day and so on! Hate it when that happens!I put the shoes on and they were larger than the normal 5.5 size. Your foot slipped forward and backwards in the shoe when walking, and then something odd happened. I turned a corner and my foot slipped right over the side of the shoe with damn near breaking my ankle. It shook me so bad that after that incident you had to be real conscious of foot placement for each foot. Making sure you carefully was square on the floor. My ankle still hurts and I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t fall with just having a total shoulder replacement. This shoe absolutely has NO ANKLE support! If you are light on your feet, have a hip replacement or shoulder replacement these shoes are NOT for you. They don\u2019t keep your feet from getting wet either. I wanted them as I can use only one arm to put shoes on. BUT who wants to wear them outside in the rain and get wet feet. The soles are made of \u201cHARD PLASTIC\u201d and they also slip on the carpet and floors. The inside of the shoe is also slick; they do however have good padding in them with arch support. Terrible design! Loved the Leather Sketchers Slip-On shoes with arch support and padding, but hate this bad yarn design. Just VERY disappointed! My doctor gave them a very bad review too! In the photo you can see the heal slips right over the side of the shoe.",

From the moment we got them, I could tell these shoes were built for both performance and style.First off, the Electric Peppermint Black colorway is amazing\u2014bright and bold, but not too flashy, and it definitely stands out. My child loves how they look, and they\u2019ve received so many compliments! The sleek design with a pop of color makes them perfect for both indoor training and casual wear.In terms of comfort, these sneakers are top-notch. The fit is true to size, and the shoes offer excellent support. The cushioned insole and breathable upper keep their feet comfortable even after hours of movement, whether they\u2019re on the court or just running around. The rubber sole provides great grip, so no slipping during quick pivots or sprints.I also love how versatile they are. These sneakers are built to handle a range of indoor sports, from basketball to training drills. And they hold up really well, even with regular wear. My child says they feel light and responsive, which is great for agility.Overall, the PUMA Attacanto sneakers are a fantastic investment. They\u2019re stylish, durable, and offer the perfect balance of comfort and performance for active kids. Highly recommend!",

I wear a size eleven and this size twelve fits perfectly.  My first pair of Puma track/driving shows four years ago.  My first pair of Puma driving shoes lasted for four years of cycling before they started to fall apart.  For cycling (or driving) these shoes are really comfortable, fit great, have great quality, and the Velcro closures solve the only problem I had with my old Puma's - the shoelaces get caught in the bike gears.  I highly recommend this shoe to cyclists and drivers.Last notes\u2026  These are not shoes for anything other than short walking distances \u2013 they aren\u2019t designed for walking, they\u2019re designed for driving while seated, and in my case and others cycling while sitting.

These taper towards the front which completely eliminated the accidental accelerator presses. The sole is stiff enough to give you great feel and they\u2019re very light.

The combination of leather and suede in the upper gives them a sleek, retro-inspired look that pairs well with various outfits. The SoftFoam+ sockliner provides excellent cushioning, making them comfortable for extended periods of walking or standing.The fit is true to size, but if you have wider feet, you might consider going half a size up, as they have a slightly narrow profile. The rubber outsole offers good traction, and the overall construction feels durable and well-made.Overall, these sneakers strike a perfect balance between style and comfort.

        "review": "The material of the boot itself is thin in a good way. It feels one with my foot since it's a snug fit. The sole is thin so you feel close to the ground, but absolutely not flimsy. It's a full rubber sole and plenty grippy and flexible.They do run small and narrow, but I prefer tight and snug for soccer cleats because I make better and more reliable/predictable contact with the ball, and my feet stay planted and don't move within the shoe.Running shoes I size like regular shoes but lace them tight and snug. Soccer cleats I size them small and tight so that the boot/shoe itself is snug and not forced by laces which is difficult to tighten and also makes for pressure points...snug cleats don't cause pressure points and are easily snug without relying so much on laces, for me. These are great and well worth the $25!!I wear a 12 in Mizuno andSaucony running shoes, and 12 in these Pumas feels pretty damn tight on me on width and length. 12.5 may be better and I could probably wear them all day, but it'd still be unusually snug on the width...but that'd be good for soccer. The 12s on me I wore for 4 hours and my feet weren't hurting at all, but when I took them off, I enjoyed the feeling of them being off. My toes are pretty much at the very end of the toe box on these 12s, yet I have a comfortable gap on my running shoes. I'm keeping the 12s because they're so smug and great. I'll probably buy longer laces so I can loosen them more easily without difficult tying.I'm not regretting my purchase at all, just sharing my experience.",

However, my recent experience with a new pair in men's size 10.5, a size I've comfortably worn in other Puma styles, left me notably disappointed. These sneakers felt unusually tight and seemed to be undersized, a stark contrast to the reliable sizing I've come to expect from the brand.Initially, I held onto the hope that the shoes would stretch and conform to my feet after a period of breaking in. This optimism led me to keep the sneakers past the point of return. Regrettably, they did not improve in fit as I had hoped, which ultimately rendered them unwearable for me. Acknowledging my misjudgment in not returning them immediately, I've decided to donate the shoes to Goodwill.This experience serves as a reminder of the variability that can occur in manufacturing and the importance of addressing fit issues promptly. While this has been a setback in my history with Puma, it also highlights the need for careful consideration when trying new styles, even from brands we know and trust.",
