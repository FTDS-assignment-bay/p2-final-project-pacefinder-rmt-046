I've been wearing ASICS for a long time now, sticking with their Kayano models for exercise, and these are definitely more narrow than those. I haven't worn them long enough yet to speak on how much stability they offer, so I might update this when I get to wear them more. For 1/2 to 1/3 of the price of the ASICS I usually buy, these might be my \"running errands\" shoes and not ones I exercise in or plan to wear when I'm going to be on my feet for long periods of time.",

If these are wide (don't appear so other than saying it) I'm sure the reg 10.5 would have been too tight.There was mention/reviews of the short shoelaces...yeah, if you use all the holes it will leave you just enough to tie them good. No extra hanging lace to trip on.... Hence, they are jogging shoes!Laces also seem thinner and cheaper than most laces I've seen but also strategic.

It was the pair of shoes I used to travel, walk, and simply wear for an everyday casual wearing. Just on the walking part alone I put no less than 500 miles.I slip in these when I travel. I can literally wear them for multiple days without worry my feet would eventually start to hurt. Trust me I\u2019ve done 24+ itineraries there\u2019s no other shoe that can match these in comfort. It looks stylish and slick, they never seem out of place.They are soft but will keep you grounded. If you prone to getting your ankles sprained these shoes are perfect.

The all black pair has always been my safe shoe with black jeans for casual looks and they blend in nice for a casual work look too. I bought a pair of the 5x ultraboost about 4 months ago, and within the first month, they were already falling apart. the bottom of the shoe was slowly peeling off, the black around the edge of the base ripped off too, I've never had a pair fall apart so quickly.Fast forward to now, I buy the 1.0 because they're more similarly shaped to ultraboosts I've purchased in the past because I'm going on a long vacation and need great walking shoes. I wore these to a baseball game to break them in and after mostly sitting, my left foot was killing me for a week. I tried loosening them, but no matter what the material under the tongue DRIVES into the top of your foot and hurts so much. That was two weeks ago, and I just told myself I need to break them in... WRONG! They still hurt and my foot is killing me. Money wasted, and now I need to find a new walking shoe because Adidas' quality has completely tanked.",

Parts of the sole are also coming unglued. I don\u2019t wear these very often and I\u2019ve had adidas that lasted 2yrs before the shoe has worn down.

I\u2019ve shared photos of what they looked like, immediately after opening the package from Amazon- just not happy about the fact that I thought I was buying BRAND NEW shoes, which these were obviously not! Since he needed the shoes now, I decided to not return them, but just wanted to leave this review to let others know what I experienced. Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe\u2026is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I\u2019ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width\u2026super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they\u2019d be slippery, but my husband says they\u2019re really not. The insoles are not as soft as his other pair (different style), but he says they feel like they\u2019ll be more durable!So I\u2019d definitely leave a 5 star review for the shoes themselves, but 3-star was given simply because they were not new, as described.",

        "review": "Pros: I\u2019ve been very happy with Adidas shoes in the past, and these are no exception: great shoes! I thought I\u2019d ordered black, but the shoes that came were actually a dark blue. For me, this was a positive because the blue is a surprisingly nice look. They feel sturdy, support my foot in all the right places, fit near perfectly, and are very comfortable to wear. Another plus for me is that they shed my dog\u2019s fur. We have a Lab that sheds like she just left the North Pole for the Sahara desert, so this was a huge and pleasant surprise. Finally, the cost of these is astoundingly inexpensive. I\u2019ve paid twice the price for shoes that weren\u2019t this comfortable.Cons: so far the only con I\u2019ve found is that the material of the soles tend to grab my socks as I\u2019m putting on the shoes. It takes a bit of doing to put on the shoes without having part of my sock pulled and folded underneath my foot. Normally this would be a big deal for me, but the shoes are so nice otherwise that it\u2019s simply not a big deal.Unknown: longevity. The pair of Adidas that this pair is replacing is 3 years old without any real issues other than I wore the soles through. Time will tell if these will hold up in a similar manor.",

They are not as narrow in fit as many of the shoes out there.  They have a nice width across the metatarsals for someone needing a slightly wider fit.  The tongue fits well in the shoe with no uncomfortable rubbing.  I have a very high instep and find some shoes are difficult to get on and become very tight across the top of my foot, no problem with that with this shoe's fit. The heel is a good height with a secure fit and has not caused any tenderness in that area.  These shoes are an excellent lightweight, nice looking, and comfortable everyday shoe.  In fact, I have enjoyed them so much that I have bought a second pair.  Highly recommended.",

They were much narrower and the sizing was off in comparisons to the 1 and 2. Brooks running shoes started to give me a pain on top of my foot. Similar to a stress fracture. So got the 3 kaptir in the closet and ran and pain went away. I like a roomy toe box when running and these 3 are not that in comparison to 1 and 2. So I ordered half a size bigger in the kaptir 3 and then also ordered my normal size in the kaptir 4 and I\u2019m very happy with the fit the comfort and the roomy toe box. Would say so far better than the 2. Haven\u2019t ran with them yet but will. Overall this is a great shoe. Never again will I waste money on brooks. The bad thing is a shoe might feel good when you try them on in the store and then once you run in them and spend time on your feet in them then you find out whether the shoe is great, good or horrible. I do treadmill running and the best success I\u2019ve had with brands is adidas kaptir. New balance several pairs have been horrible, Pegasus 39 have been horrible for running but great walking shoe, numerous other adidas, one time a puma. So far adidas surpasses brooks, Nike, puma, new balance for running.",

Couldn't be happier they are super light and comfortable that cloud foam definitely takes a lot of the pressure off of your legs. While I love my Air Max 90s these for a quarter of the price where worn 90% of the time walking around on my trip because they were so comfortable in that saying a lot seeing as the Air Max 90 is one of the most comfortable shoes I've ever owned so I would say these are full five Stars based on price their ability and comfort plus they look kind of retro love them!!!!!",

        "review": "Compr\u00e9 los Adidas Run 72 para hombre en Amazon y no podr\u00edan haber superado mis expectativas. Estos tenis combinan un dise\u00f1o retro inspirado en los a\u00f1os 70 con un toque moderno que los hace perfectos para uso casual. El color blanco con negro que eleg\u00ed es elegante y vers\u00e1til, ideal para combinar con jeans o ropa deportiva.Comodidad: La amortiguaci\u00f3n Cloudfoam es un gran punto a favor; se sienten ligeros y c\u00f3modos desde el primer uso, como si caminaras sobre una nube. La plantilla de espuma con memoria ofrece un soporte excelente, especialmente para estar de pie o caminar durante varias horas. La parte superior de malla y cuero sint\u00e9tico es transpirable, manteniendo mis pies frescos incluso en d\u00edas calurosos.Calidad: Los materiales, aunque no son premium, son duraderos y bien ensamblados. La suela de goma ofrece buen agarre en superficies urbanas, aunque puede ser un poco resbaladiza en suelos mojados. Los detalles de gamuza y las ic\u00f3nicas tres rayas le dan un look aut\u00e9ntico y robusto. Llevo us\u00e1ndolos varias semanas y siguen como nuevos.Talla y ajuste: Ped\u00ed mi talla habitual (US 9.5 ) y me quedaron perfectos, aunque algunos comentarios mencionan que pueden sentirse un poco grandes. Recomiendo medir bien tus pies o consultar la gu\u00eda de tallas de Amazon para mayor seguridad. El ajuste es c\u00f3modo, pero si usas plantillas ortop\u00e9dicas, considera pedir media talla m\u00e1s.Precio y env\u00edo: Los consegu\u00ed en oferta. La relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio es imbatible para unos Adidas originales.Conclusi\u00f3n: Los Adidas Run 72 son una gran elecci\u00f3n si buscas unos tenis con estilo retro, c\u00f3modos y asequibles. Perfectos para el uso diario, caminatas ligeras o simplemente para lucir bien. \u00a1Los recomiendo totalmente y probablemente comprar\u00e9 otro par en un color diferente!",

I ordered my usual size, and it felt like my toes were at a clown car convention. So, I had to send them back and get a size up. In ten years of buying Adidas, this was a first\u2014like finding out your favorite coffee shop suddenly sells 5 dollar-foot longs. Not a deal-breaker, just a quirky surprise.Other than that, they\u2019re stylish and true to the photos. No Photoshop magic here, folks.

There is room for an insole/orthotic/ arch support without taking out the insole they come with.They offer support but not enough cushioning for running. Better to get options like Adidas  alphabounce or New Balance fresh foam x or good budget high foam runners like  Allswifit.These adidas are very much like a cozy pair of moccasins you love.

When I first put them on, I felt they were a little snug around the sides. I walked around in them when I took my kids for a walk, then took them off for the day. However, the next day, I slipped them on, and BAM, they fit like a glove! For my high arch they provide enough support. Even with no-show socks on, the rim of the shoe has yet to give me blisters. They feel snug enough where if I run I don\u2019t feel like they will come off, but not so snug where they are uncomfortable. I believe they are designed for a more \u201ccustom feel\u201d, thus why they may feel snug or tight initially. For my size 7 foot, they fit nicely. I do not run, so I cannot comment on how practical they are as a running shoe. But as a mom of two kids under 5, I can vouch for their comfort as an every day sneaker.",

        "review": "Fantastic shoe...I bought these having never worn Adidas running shoes. I did have an Adidas hiking shoe that was indestructible, but eventually wore out. I have been wearing Nike Pegasus for years. The Pegasus fit and feel is great, especially for a narrow foot. Price had become too costly, like most shoes. So after some time watching and reading reviews, I took a gamble on the Supernova Prima. Only a few days in to wearing, I have zero complaints. They feel like plush toys. Mind you, I walk; very little running, no high mileage, etc. just day to day wearing to work and for exercise.They are lightweight, and roomier than the Pegasus in the forefoot. I should also point out that they probably run a half size bigger. I wear a men's 12D. But I'm keeping these - colder months, room for thicker socks. The semi-gusseted tongue is also great; a soft, thin, pillowtop-esque portion of tongue is unique to this shoe. The upper is soft like a jersey feel. I wish the outsole was more like the waffle of a Nike or even had the Adidas Continental rubber, but not a dealbreaker.I put non-custom orthotics in mine. Heel feels cushiony and ball of foot is the same, bounce like.I'll admit the hyper turquoise accent color is awful. And if you go for the most current model, color selection is terrible. Not sure why Adidas would choose chain gang gray/highlighter and light communist gray as the 2 color options instead of anything else, but they did.If I can update review after 3 months, I can speak to durability. Will be walking in these all summer. Feet happy.",

I feel like my strides are light and I get a lot of cushioning. I have walked dozens of miles in a day with these and enjoyed myself at concerts and shows too with no foot ache or cramp to speak of afterwards. Just wish they looked a bit more sleek like the original run, but you get the benefit of comfort and performance for a great daily walker and they're priced well enough you can beat on it without feeling bad. I'd likely pickup another pair just to rotate designs and keep them both looking a bit less beat up overtime. If you are looking for ideal running shoes, these are not bad but you are probably better served with something for even more high-impact that doesn't completely \"deaden\" the floor underneath you with the cushioning while still providing good return for energy spent. In other words, these are light, but not light enough for performance running, but in the excellent sweet spot for daily wear and even easy jogging, basketball, and light sports or long hikes on even terrain (I would recommend more proper trail shoes with better grip for more imbalanced terrain).",

The actual small area on the top does not really vent the heat from my feet adequately.At this point, 2 days after receipt, the only issue I see is the shoe is without question the most difficult to put on shoe I have ever owned.There are no finger loops on the heel nor tongue.Without finger loops you are forced to awkwardly spear the front of your foot into the shoe and employ either you fingers (sucks) or in my case a long handled shoe horn to slide your foot into the shoe.More to come as further investigation is allowed.",

As a woman wearing men's sizes they can be tightened a good bit for a narrow foot. Unfortunately they saved by loosing some breathability. They are comfortably warm with mid weight socks in 85\u00b0 but wouldn't be ideal for seriously warm summer hiking. The back of the ankle is taller than many shoes, which took some breaking in. Lastly, when tightened I notice some warping of the water repellent around the toes, so I suspect they may not be super durable, but I'm sure they'll get through a few months/few hundred miles.TLDR: good for their price, a little toasty",

Oh, and occasionally I'd add a comfort pad if I knew it'd be a long day on my feet; but quite honestly, they're cushy soft anyway and found it was not necessary.  My feet were never sore at any time or even by the end of a long walking day; amazing!Second.  They did get a little dirty, and even more so at home from constant wear (love them so much).  I have thrown them in a snug garment bag multiple different times, tossed them in the washing machine on a cold water wash and they wash up beautifully without any damage or breakdown to the shoes - but air dry them.Third.  They are so fashionable.  They not only feel great but they look fantastic with everything you wear.  I've had so many unexpected compliments on them.  As I mentioned before, I also bought the silver/green pair.  They're gorgeous.  What a great color!So overall, I am SUPER happy with the style, fit, durability and comfort of these shoes.  I'd give them 100 stars if I could.",

        "review": "I absolutely love these adidas! I had the previous model of these shoes, that is very similar. They have made a few minor changes on this model. The ankle area is a slightly different shape and the front of the shoe seems to have a little added structure. Overall it\u2019s very similar to the previous model but does look a tiny bit different and more updated. I do like this model better! I am a big fan of adidas cloudfoam. I love that you can tie them once and slip them on and off. Obviously they are super comfortable, hence the name cloudfoam. I have washed my previous model in the washing machine (air dry) and they have always come out fine. I use them for everyday and also walking my dog for exercise. I have one pair for exercise and one pair for casual wear with jeans and leggings. They are super cute and easily go with everything due to the neutral colors offered. They look feminine and stylish. The previous model of this shoe I have in size 7.5 and this model I have in a size 8. I noticed that people weren\u2019t saying this shoe runs as large as the previous model did, so that\u2019s why I ordered my normal size 8. I\u2019m glad I did, they fit perfectly. I would recommend these for everyday or for walking/exercise. Personally I would not recommend these for long distance running because I think this is more of a low impact walking shoe in my opinion. Maybe this would be fine for running for some, but back when I was running (I just walk now due to an injury) I would\u2019ve picked a shoe with a thicker sole and more shock impact protection. Everyone is different. I have tried to run in these and they weren\u2019t as good as my Nike revolution 5 running shoe. They weren\u2019t terrible for running though, there\u2019s just better choices imo! Overall these shoes are great! I would imagine this would be a great shoe if you are on your feet all day.  Side note, to all you moms out there who live in leggings like me (lol) these look super cute paired with leggings!",

I\u2019m not a big runner, so I can\u2019t speak to how they\u2019d hold up for serious running, but I imagine they might wear out too quickly if used for that.For my purposes, they\u2019re great. I wear them every day for walks, and they usually last me about 4\u20135 months before the soles start to wear down and they begin to look a little dirty. That said, even after that point, I still keep using them\u2014they\u2019re that comfortable.They go with everything, feel super lightweight, and are easy to slip on and off. Highly recommend if you\u2019re looking for an everyday sneaker for walking, errands, or light workouts!",

Only problem is they sent me a 8 1/2.  At first I was devastated because these are the cutest most comfortable shoes I\u2019ve ever had. (Not exaggerating.)However they do run big, lengthwise, so they fit.  They were too tight at the opening and since there\u2019s no tongue, I thought they\u2019d never fit.  However after breaking them in by walking around the house and manually stretching that spot, they do fit.  I\u2019m afraid to exchange for a 9, because they would be too long.  My feet already have a little wiggle room in the 8 1/2 and the mesh is ever so slightly stretchy.  I\u2019d recommend getting your usual size, unless your feet are very wide, in that case size up. I would size down if you have VERY narrow feet.  I hope this helps. They\u2019re adorable and I can\u2019t wait to wear them teaching all day!",

They\u2019re stable, breathable, and surprisingly light, with just the right amount of firm cushioning to keep my feet supported from clock-in to clock-out. No break-in period was needed\u2014they were comfortable from day one.I normally wear a size 11.5, but I went with a 12 wide for a little extra space. I\u2019ve got a foot condition, and this gave me enough room for healing without feeling loose or sloppy. The added width helped relieve pressure on my toes, and the fit still felt secure around the heel and midfoot. That small adjustment in size made all the difference for long hours and recovery.The cushioning is more firm than soft, which I actually prefer for standing all day. It holds up under pressure and gives real support without collapsing. Even after 10+ hours, my feet don\u2019t ache or feel beat up. The mesh upper keeps air flowing, and the shoe feels lightweight without sacrificing durability.After reading other reviews, I\u2019ve found my experience lines up\u2014people mention walking thousands of steps comfortably, and many say it\u2019s one of the best options for long-term wear. Some recommend sizing up slightly if you\u2019re between sizes, especially for a wider toe box. I\u2019d agree with that.Overall, this isn\u2019t just a good running shoe\u2014it\u2019s a great all-day work shoe. It\u2019s built for comfort, stability, and endurance. Whether you\u2019re on a hard surface all day or just need something dependable for recovery, this pair won\u2019t let you down.",

I am very glad that I listened to this advice. When I first got the shoes, even at size 11 they still seemed a bit small, but now after using them for a couple of weeks they have broken in and fit just right! So now they do fit, but with like no extra room. If you like a little extra room in your shoes then go with 1 full size larger.

At first, I thought the sole on these was so bizarre in the heel that I nearly returned them. However, I ended up deciding to give them a try anyway and I was SO pleasantly surprised!! I LOVE how wide the toe box is and they are very supportive. They're a little chunky because of the thick heel, but overall they're pretty light and super comfortable. Great value for quality. I've had them for a few months now and have already put quite a bit of wear on them, and they're still very comfortable. I haven't experienced any pain/blistering and they're helping my knees as I'm doing PT and getting back into my hobby. Very happy I found these!",

These have a good mesh amount to keep your feet cool but enough solid area to keep them dry if you are dealing with minimal amounts of water. The heel is a bit bulky but provides a lot of extra support. I love the bright orange color. I always try to get bright colors for hiking gear just in case I need to be seen. The only complaint I have is that they are tad narrow. I have a narrow foot, and these are snug on me. It's not an uncomfortable amount though. They will also stretch more as I wear them in. Length wise they are true to size. I wear a 7 and these have the perfect amount of room between the tip of the shoe and the tip of my big toe. If I went a half size bigger for width they would be too long. I have another pair of Adidas I wear to the gym that I had to go half a size smaller (Adidas Swift Run).

They have very good heel support and the toe is great, with good support and springy take off! The toe box is very comfortable on my size 13 normal width (D) feet. I like the reinforced eyelets. Very good traction. The arch support is very nice too. They feel light and lively.The BAD: The shoe strings are crap and will definitely get replaced. The tongue is non-gusseted but has a loop on the tongue that allows the second and third lace to go through it and help control positioning. I prefer a gusseted tongue.These are brand new, I just got them today. Opened the box and went for a quick 5 mile run so can't speak to durability.

The original web description was worded differently and it, along with Amazon\u2019s product page, identifying the sizes as \u201cWide\u201d were what I'd trusted and based my purchase on. The web search is misleading when one asks if this specific shoe model comes in \u201cwide\u201d and this plus Amazon\u2019s product page are wrong! The Adidas website does not have wide sizes either. Buyer beware.In my actual wear experience and going by the shoe tag and box, these shoes are not truly \u201cwide,\u201d and they hurt my feet. I will notify Amazon to change the width to regular or standard, from \u201cwide.\u201d__________Original review: I purchased these in size 6.5 Wide in Men's sizing. Amazon was the only carrier of the Wide version at the time. My typical women's size is 7 to 7.5 extra wide. I usually need an extra wide width due to two bilateral bunions, which make my feet sensitive with any pressure. My usual shoes are Brooks and New Balance. Runrepeat gave these shoes a high rating and, after reading their research about the toe box width, toe box height, great durability, and the customer reviews from other sites, I ordered these. I dislike spending full price, but this shoe brand and style/type (+ width) have sold quickly. They are my favorite sports shoes, stable, lightweight, and are comfortably cushioned. Worth the full price, imo. (See revised review above.)",

Affordable, worth every penny I paid. the color is unmistakable so when i walk at night i am definitely seen. they are very thin and lightweight material. when they came in the mail today i thought there was going to be only one shoe in there because of how lightweight the package was. too bad winter is coming soon. i live in chicago and i definitely won't be able to wear these in the snow and rain. that is the only downside. other than that, i want these shoes for the rest of my life!!",

But quite difficult without one, because of the stretchy sock that helps keep your foot in place during long runs.  This shoe is most known for its comfort, and ability to give help in forward propulsion when your heel hits the ground.  The effect is not as pronounced as some Nikes, that also have a higher differential between heel height and front of shoe.  For folks accustomed to Zero naked feet flat shoes, these can be too much heellThese wash beautifully in the washing machine.  But don\u2019t put them in the dryer.",

I usually have to rotate shoes or sneak in a pair of sandals mid-day, but not this time. These Ultraboosts were light, breathable, and so ridiculously cushioned that I started referring to them as my \u201cwalking clouds.\u201d I\u2019m not even kidding.The Grey/White/Blue color combo is even better in person, stylish enough to match all my park outfits but subtle enough that they didn\u2019t scream \u201cnew shoes at a theme park.\u201d They\u2019re sleek, cute, and made me feel like I was walking on memory foam wrapped in marshmallows.Fit-wise, they were perfect right out of the box. I didn\u2019t even have to break them in (which is a Disneyland miracle). I wear a size 9 and found them true to size with just enough wiggle room for swelling after 12 hours on my feet.Bonus: they didn\u2019t stain or scuff easily, even after a churro mishap and a surprise splash from Pirates of the Caribbean. Clean-up was easy, and they still look brand new.If you\u2019re headed to the parks or just need something comfy for all-day errands, buy these. Your feet will thank you. Mine are still applauding.",

But omg they hurt so bad. First thing I did was try them on in the house and they squeaked but I figured, eh maybe that will stop. Thankfully once there was some dirt on them, it did. They also felt a bit snug around the top of my foot but I figured eh, maybe that will loosen over time because obviously loosening up the ties does nothing on a shoe with a built in tongue. They were comfortable in all the other ways, but it did not loosen. I wore these on a trip to Las Vegas and the tops of my feet hurt SO bad by the end of day 2 of walking around. I wore sandals off and on for the rest of the trip and absolutely dreaded putting them back on for the airplane ride home. That's when I noticed my feet were legit BRUISED on top, from the weird pressure under the laces on my foot. There is no way to fix it and if it happens to you, just know that it won't loosen. You will hate these shoes that are so comfortable in every other way.I even went so far as to googling this issue, where I landed on the many Reddit threads full of other people wondering what in the world is going on with these shoes. I don't think it's just me. I have pretty small feet and I do not have high arches at all. Buy these at your own risk.",

I used to be a Nike Vaporfly fan, but due to a past injury that keeps flaring up, I couldn't wear them anymore, and so I decided to give these a shot, and boy they felt amazing. Plus, they don't give me that 'hot shoe' foot feel (nor blisters) after my runs unlike my Nike Vaporfly ones. Really happy with these shoes. Only down side though is the sizing.

Lightweight ones, max cushion, racers, and let me tell you if I could start over and have 1 shoe, THIS is it.I didn\u2019t even notice this shoe on my 8 mile long slow run at 11:00/mile easy pace. It zoomed right on during 4:30/mile pace strides. It handled my 8:00 tempo pace with ease. Everything about this shoe executes without complication. It is simply seamless.I don\u2019t mean to glaze, I\u2019m just genuinely so impressed.This is a firmer shoe. If you weigh 110lbs I don\u2019t know that you\u2019ll like it. As an average 175lb guy, this is money. It has a lot of bounce with the foam and the rods (used instead of a plate). The continental outsole grip is insane and super planted. Very stable as well.The upper is not perfect. I need a runners loop to get a semi decent heel lock down. Not a deal breaker, everything else is 10/10.If someone asked me what shoe do I buy for all of my runs I\u2019d tell them this. New runner? This. First 5K, 10K or half shoe? This. Long run shoe?

If you\u2019re a runner or walker this would definitely be a good shoe to buy.",

        "review": "So I ordered these shoes back in late May because I needed new shoes for walking and own numerous pairs of Adidas sneakers. Well these caught my eye and were on sale for under $40 so obviously I bought them! Well when they arrived I tried them on and they literally looked like I was ready for the circus because they were so big. I wear a size 7 to a 7.5 in my fully enclosed shoes. Since I planned to wear thicker socks and a killer sale price I ordered a 7.5. Well these have to be a men\u2019s size because they were so big but comfortable. Well I went to order a smaller size and was shocked that they were double the cost. So I returned them and ordered two other styles in 3 different sizes, only to keep one pair in a size 7. I still wanted these but at the $40 price point, so I watched and waited. While waiting, returning other pairs, and reading ALL reviews I had a better idea of the size that would probably work. Obviously the size chart wasn\u2019t accurate and didn\u2019t help the first time. Finally after after 2 months the price dropped and I ordered the replacement pair in a size 6.5. I tried them on and they are still a little big even with thick socks on but not bad enough for another return. A size 6 would be perfect with toe wiggle room but these will work. They are extremely padded especially around the Achilles tendon and ankle portion. The cushion almost has a \u201cgel\u201d padding feel and surrounds the outer part of the foot. So my other pairs of Adidas sneakers range from a 5 to a 7! This brand doesn\u2019t seem to be consistent with size but are worth it when you find your fit. These are noticeably heavier on then most sneakers but that is do to the really thick shock absorbing sole and the padding. However it\u2019s not heavy enough for me to give up the comfort. I have clubbed toes on my left foot and this shoe doesn\u2019t bother me. So in conclusion I went from a 7.5 down to a 6.5 and could\u2019ve easily worn a 6! So I would suggest sizing down at least a half size down minimal. I expect they\u2019ll last me at least a year or more easily with this being used as a primary daily shoe. So be prepared for a possible return or wearing thicker socks. I hope this helps and good luck with your purchase!",

        "review": "When I write reviews I like to be thorough so as to help people truly make an informed decision, so, here goes: The shoe is GREAT looking in person, the white color scheme I chose goes with everything, which is important to a person like me who always needs to match. The comfort of the shoe is 5 stars, it's like working out on a cloud, and I don't say that lightly. The shoe hits 5 stars for everything BUT..the sizing. It's never easy going through sizing discrepancy reviews because there's never enough detail or comparison, I'm gonna give you some. The size 10 shoe, is going for $26, 2 weeks ago, I ordered the 9.5 and it was on sale for $39. Now 9.5 is up & the size 9, only the size 10 is for $26 because the sizing is so off I'll bet they are stuck with a bunch of returns and regular inventory for that size. I got the 9.5 cheaper than it is now and I think the price went up because normal size 10 wearers grew aware of this so went for the next size down, and the one after that, driving the price up, which is my only issue with this product or seller. Shoes should be the same price across the board like they've always been but consumers are now having to pay more for the sellers not being detailed enough in their product as to write a product description that would aide consumers in choosing the right size and lowering returns & exchanges. I am normally between a 9.5 & 10 shoe size. For heels it's usually a 10, with the rare shoe still being too small. For a tennis shoe it's usually a 9.5 as a 10 is usually too big, except for the rare occasion it's just right. To give you an idea of my foot: I am 5'9, 130lbs, I am built long, bony, & muscular but my hands & feet don't have an ounce of fattie tissue on them & they don't swell. When a shoe fits, ot fits, when it doesn't, it doesnt. This shoe surprised the heck out of me because I don't remember the last time a size 9.5 sneaker felt like a 10.5. I can get away with the 9.5 because I've put a shoe insert in & I wear thick socks & the laces tie up very securely, which is another plus. My workouts are going just fine save for the stairmaster. I hate dealing with exchanges & returns so if I can make it work then I will, so thankfully, I could make due-but, I want others to know why the price discrepancy differences and what shoe size may work. If you are built bony like me but also have gunboats for feet, I would say go a full size down. Even me going to my usual 9.5, my lowest size, was barely doable, only so because I've got a good thick insole insert. If you have thicker feet, I'd say go half a size down because with this shoe it's not the width of the shoe that's the problem, the shoe cinches up & loosens great, it's the length of the shoe that's inaccurate. I still recommend this shoe, but I am a gym rat & go through sneakers like crazy so I'll get a new pair when I run through these, that's how much I love them. I hope this review helps and I hope I was detailed enough because it always bothers me when I don't know the body style of the person who is saying \"too big/too small, too tall/too short\", etc, because it does make a difference, for comparative purposes. It's for this lone reason that I give the shoe 4 stars instead of 5, because it was just too far off base. Hope this helps, everyone!",

(I actually tried the Boys X_PLR Boost Sneaker on in the big kids size at a shoe store, and they were very comfortable, but I would have needed a boys size 7 and they did not have it).These X_PLR Phase women's sneakers are not as cushy comfortable as the X_PLR Boost big kids version. The reviews stated they run large so I sized down: I normally wear 8.5 to 9 in women's shoes so I tried it in a size 8, which fit snug in the toes, but b/c these slant downwards from back to front then my foot was pushed downwards on the downward slant right into the toes, and the toes have rubber around the edge in the front which is hard, so it just pushed my toes downward into the front of the shoe,  and it was too tight in the toes, and then too loose in the heels on me.I felt ordering a half size up they would be too big.Also, I did not find that the cushioned soles on these were as cushiony as the X_PLR Boost big kids version, the 'Phase' seems less 'cushy' than the 'Boost'  X_PLR.As stated in other reviews,  the back of the heel is so-o-o big, and sticks out so far surrounding your heel, some said 'like clown shoes,' that I did not like the way this looked as well.So back these go, and still trying to find some women's sneakers that fit and are comfortable.",

She mentioned how incredibly comfortable they feel, even after wearing them all day at school and during playtime. The color combination was a big hit with her\u2014stylish and fun without being too loud. One of the best parts is how easy they are for her to slip on and off, which is great for busy mornings. No complaints about sore feet at the end of the day, which tells me they\u2019re made really well. Highly recommend for kids who are active and on their feet a lot",

They have laces but they are just to Snug the sneakers up and not really to hold them on your feet per se. In case you have not worn sneakers like this before you may be surprised to find out that the tongue is attached to the shoe so don't let that throw you if you're going to order these. They do fit nicely on the foot as long as you get your regular size so there's nothing to worry about. They're quite comfortable and fit like a dream in my opinion that's why I have three pairs of them now. And the price is certainly reasonable. I didn't pay more than $50 a pair for any of my three pairs of Swift run twos. And actually got one pair for $38 delivered free. So what's not to like? Comfortable attracted to deal with shoes under 50 bucks that I will get at least 3 years out of. I consider that to be a super cool volume shoes that fit good and look great. Highly recommended! One thing though I would say that these would be more suited to a casual shoe than possibly a serious running shoe. Not much of a heel counter here. But if you're looking for a cool shoe to wear with jeans this is the bomb.",

I have some Adidas Kaptirs as well and they support the heck out of your heels and arches, but these Run 22s are just like walking on a cloud all over. They don't exactly support separate areas, just pad your feet as a whole. I feel like I am walking on clouds! Even after 2 hours of treadmill at the gym, my feet still feel great.

        "review": "I love these so far.  First day with them.From what I can tell they are an Adidas entry into the lifestyle shoe trend and borrow styling from 1970's running and track shoes.  I certainly wouldn't run with these, but as a daily wear shoes they kind of speak to, yes, I was a decent if mediocre track runner years ago and I still weekend warrior run into middle age and am doing ok with it (albeit with a separate, dedicated set of shoes).  If you flip these over the soles have circles that to me evoke the sockets that you would screw your metal track spikes into.I tried on the Adidas SL 72 RS, a more true to original lifestyle form of a once popular track shoe.  Those are tighter and maybe fit more like a pair you would lace up to run track with in school. These are a bit looser fitting, so perhaps a bit better for a daily wear.What is present on both is a canvas vinyl type material that is perhaps true to the heritage.  However, some wearers seem to not like how the material does not bend and flex along the more pliable suede overlays.  To me it's just a characteristic, but it's there.  If you're curious about how it may look after you worn the shoes take a look at photos submitted by other reviewers.But me I love these!  Love the fit, the comfort, the vibe.  It's what I was looking for.",

So I was happy to find one that looked good and felt good.They are really light and breathable and fit true to size with a good amount of room in the toe box. The back of the heel makes them easy to put on and the laces seem to stay tied throughout the day.I'm going to keep an eye on some of the other colors to go on sale because $180 seems like a lot for a pair of shoes to me.

One disappointing part is the left shoe has a small piece of material on the inside at the front that is attached to the sole but is not attached at the top of it and my big toe touches it. It feels like a toe reinforcement that didn't get completely sewn in. For the price I paid, I'll put up with it.",

        "review": "I liked these shoes, so I ordered them going by the reviews thinking they would help me work a comfortable 10-hour shift but was sadly mistaken. Tried wearing them without an insole, and with two separate insoles with no look. The shoelaces are extremely too short for one, they rubbed the sides of my feet so badly that by the time I got home I had to elevate my feet cuz I could barely walk. I loosened the shoelaces hoping to give my foot more room but no matter how loose I made the shoelaces I was still left in extreme pain. Normally I do not wear a wide shoe, which is why I did not order a wide. Honestly I'm not even sure a wide would have fit me comfortably because the material up top is not very flexible at all. I even tried to wear them for two or three days before wearing them to work to break them in and it didn't help at all. After wearing them for one week, I'd had enough and decided to send them back. So if anyone does a job on their feet for 10 hours and does a lot of moving from left to right these are not the shoes for you. Unless you are a sucker for pain the only part of your foot that will not hurt is the heel of your foot. There's no proper arch support and not enough padding around the toes and ball of the feet, let alone toe room for an active person. I will be finding something else. This makes me leery of buying any other Adidas shoes.",

I was lookin for a pair of running shoes with more support so I thought trail running shoes might be the answer, however, I used them to run two 10K's on the pavement. I found the size to be accurate, and them to be very well build. However, in my opinion they don't have very good cushioning and are too tall. Hence I can't tie them down tight enough to hold in place while i'm running. So my feet slide around while running. This probably would not be a problem for trail runners who wear thicker socks, but in my case they were a waste of money.",

        "review": "I remember seeing these as a kid on my friend and some adults and thought to try them, I was a fan of Adidas as I loved the originals sneakers collection and one of my teachers had spoke about how the shoe felt like indoor cleats, I thought to finally try them.A great pair of shoes especially for the money, I probably wore these shoes over a thousand times too, to the point where there were holes and I had to get rid of them a few weeks ago. My first reaction when I got the shoes was that they were very light, at first you kind of have to break them in. They may seem a bit snug and may hurt a little bit. Perhaps it hurted me more than others because I have flat feet. After a week when you break them in, they sort of shape to your feet. It will feel comfortable and you'll feel as light as a feather, the shoes are great for athletics and they are very aesthetically pleasing, more so I liked how the shoe was rather versatile. If I wanted to wear some chinos, or some casual wear it wouldn't look to bad infact it would play the part. what I absolutely loved about these sneakers is how you can simply slip them on, I always hated those sneakers that you had to untie and worry about the shoe getting creases and what not. I however found that after a while, the shoe felt like it was slipping off and that it may have expanded during the time I was wearing, again nothing too big but it felt like it grew about 1/2 over the time I had it.  This became my go to shoe whenever I was leaving, I didn't even dare look at the others as my feet had gone through so much uncomfort when I went back. The shoe can get rather slippery in the winter and on wet areas so you need to be careful there but it's not like they're meant to be used during the winter. One of the things that I disliked about the shoe is how I had to keep on tying the laces several times, perhaps this had to with the laces mainly but I felt like it was the shoe moving from place to place as it started to expand and stretch. During the shoes last dying dies, I start to get holes from the ongoing times I've worn it, I knew it wouldn't last the way I treated it but for $40+ I didn't very much care. I later discovered that the inside of the shoes is composed of mainly some kind of cardboard, kind of surprising how such a comfortable fit could be made from such cheap material.I would recommend these to a friend, perhaps you may not want to wear them as much as I did however if you plan on making them last but it's great and with a price like that. You can't really go wrong. Would I buy them again however, there are many other shoes in the market and I'm willing to try many and see where they take me but I will have flashbacks of all the events that I had with my pair of shoes. I never begun to adore a shoe like that, no matter how much damage and dirt and stretching it went through, it managed and still had an amazing authentic look.",

        "review": "TL;DR: Great shoes, will mold to fit you like a glove, and last for at least a year of heavy use. Get the Samba Originals if you prefer a short tongue.About me: I'm on my fourth pair of Samba Classics. In a row. I love this shoe, and I think you will too. That being said, here's what I think you need to know:I first started wearing these shoes because I needed something with a flat sole to dance in (I did musicals in high school, and I wore straight through a pair of running shoes), and I fell completely in love with them. I wear them 100% of the time when it isn't raining and there isn't snow on the ground. I have also worn them for their \"intended purpose\" - indoor soccer - and find they work great there too.I would DEFINITELY recommend these shoes for serious walking, dancing, or indoor soccer. NOTE WELL: they will mold to your feet as if you were born wearing them, and will change their appearance somewhat once broken in (the leather will look a lot less shiny, and will develop a flatter fit across your foot), in my opinion much for the better. Like all leather shoes, these have a break in period, and I find it's less than a week. Once broken in, they feel AWESOME, and last a very long time: my last three pairs lasted between 1 year and 1.5 years each, depending on the amount of walking I did (walking increased when I went to college). They're also very comfortable walking / standing shoes. I've never gotten blisters or pains from them.I would NOT recommend these shoes for rain, snow, ice, hiking, or serious running. The flat sole, which makes them great for traction on flat, dry surfaces, falls short on all of these things. Since they are leather, they're fairly water resistant, and a coat of water repellent spray will make them very water resistant (and avoid winter salt water stains), but water WILL get in around the tongue, which is not attached at the sides, only at the front.These shoes tend to wear in two places: the interior heel (the back of the inside lining), which will develop holes if you're a fan of slipping your shoes on and off (which I don't recommend: these are leather, they're meant to be tied snug); and the sole, which will gradually wear toward smooth. I find that the sole and the upper wear at about the same rate: i.e. by the time the sole is worn to the point of noticeable slippage on wet surfaces, the shoes themselves look like they're ready to be replaced. If you don't care about these two factors (or you want a pair of old shoes to work in), they will basically last forever. I still use my first pair for construction, painting, and mowing the lawn. They're over four years old and the leather will probably outlast everything else in my life.These shoes are essentially identical to the Samba Originals, the difference being that these have a longer tongue. Some people don't like the tongue, which is reminiscent of soccer cleats, but I like it because it makes the shoes pop a bit more, and goes well with long casual pants, with which you can wear the tongue outside of the pants (the tongue is also not uncomfortable with shorts, especially after it gets bent forward a bit by being worn with long pants).",

        "review": "Honestly one of the best shoes on the market for wide foot people, if your looking to snag a simple set of running sneakers, in my opinion. Here's some in-depth info along with  pro's and con's:TLDR: Great quality shoes for the price, and easy to clean. Recommend to beginner and intermediate runners/hikers, experts may be willing to pay more money for increase of quality.PROs:- Perfect Fit. I usually wear 9.0 wide (USA), so that is what I ordered and it fit perfectly.- Comfort and Ease. I like how comfortable they are and they are easy to slip on and off (if you wish) by the use of the heel pull tab. The tab also prevents the heel from getting bunched in or broken when putting on the shoes, which was a frequent problem with some other brands I have owned in the past.- Easy to Clean, Quality Mesh. I have seen some reviews saying these shoes wear out easily or the mesh is easier to damage. YMMV but I didn't seem to have this issue and I've had these shoes for about a year. IMO I find the mesh to be much more durable than the cloth mesh most sports shoes have these days and much easier to clean, which is essential for anyone like myself, who often hikes or runs in forestry/mud.- Above Average Quality. As for the year timeframe, the 1st set was about 8 months of extreme use, then I purchased a 2nd pair which I've had for about 3 months now. This may seem like a short timeframe to some but for me, I usually have to change shoes every 6 months or less if they are lower quality because they get a lot of mileage and use. I still have the 1st set which I use as \"lawn mowing shoes\", as they are still usable but the tread does not get much grip/traction anymore for running. I liked them enough to buy that 2nd pair instead of some other brand/model.- Decent Arch Support and Sole Tread. You will find other shoes with the same or better, but I didn't see many that were this cheap in price.- Part of Amazon's \"Try Before You Buy\". Free try-ons. You can take up to 6 days to decide whether to keep/return if you wish, and only be charged if not returned by the 7th day. Day 1 is the day they are delivered.- Uniform in Color. The shoe currently comes in all-black or all-white, including the logo. YMMV but this is a pro for me due to work restrictions requiring all-black shoes, so I can also wear them leisurely at work if I choose (I'm a mechanic). Great for anyone with the same issue, or military, etc.CONs:- Not the most expert/elite quality shoe out there, but will definitely check most people's boxes for average needs, imo.- Cost is higher than one might desire for just simple leisure shoes. But as an avid runner, the price is about average. However, they are usually on sale. My 1st set was around 40% off which dropped it from $70-something to $43, which was worth it for me. 2nd set was about 20% off. Winter holiday seems to be the best time for sales price.- Tread pattern is smooth and circular, instead of rigid and square/triangle, in case that matters to you (in regards to rock climbing etc)Overall I was surprisingly satisfied with this shoe model personally, but your mileage may vary.",

I ordered multiple Brooks to try on and none was a truly good fit.I'm going to be doing a lot of walking, so I may purchase an additional insert but for everyday wear they are more than adequate without an insert.I'm happy to find a new brand, that has a dependable sizing system.Shoe quality:The quality appears to be goodArch support:arch support is goodMaterial thickness:SubstantialColor:blackSlip resistance:hopefully good I haven't been able to test drive in wet surfaces yetLightweight:yes, lightweight",

I broke a few toes 2 years ago and since then the toe area is too tight and hurts to walk, and I have very narrow feet so finding shoes are hard....most shoes that said wide toe box, the shoe itself was wide also. My daughter mentioned she wears Adidas and they are pretty roomy in the toe area. I read the reviews and someone else had mention this. So I bought a pair and they are like a dream on my feet! This pair is my second pair. I am able to walk long distances, stand on my feet in one place for hours, and ride my bike without hurting. Durable and Great Support all over. I purchased black and pink which are perfect for where I work as they wipe off easily. I haven't washed them yet, but I feel like they would withstand a trip in the washer. Only issue I have with them is where the tongue attaches to the area at the top of the laces (closest to the toes), I have to shove my finger in to smooth it out before tying or it's uncomfortable. Otherwise, these are my go to shoes going forward!",

The stitching used is obviously good quality, but is usually only seen if you lift the insert of the sneaker. But as stated before, there is no insert (imo) so now I\u2019m expected to buy an additional product to accommodate what I thought would naturally just be a part of a sneaker to be purchased by me, the consumer. I did not realize that the cloud comfort foam is not meant to be directly felt by my feet, but rather an insert that is not included with the sneakers themselves, and must be purchased individually (that doesn\u2019t even consider that \u201cthe right insert\u201d might be hard to find for any multitude of reasons $).",

Adidas seem to provide a modicum of arch support. Not much, but at least some. The shoes take a beating, plus washings, and still look new by the time grandkid has to size up. This is his most recent size up when he turned 5. He picked these because he liked the design and thought it looked cool.

I needed something lightweight, trail-ready, and supportive enough for hours of running, climbing, and wading through deep mud \u2014 and they delivered big time.I absolutely adore these shoes. They held up through 15K of mud, water, obstacles, and nonstop movement. I was knee-deep in 2.5 feet of mud for much of the race, and not once did they slip, rub, or make my feet ache. The tread was fantastic for trail grip, and the arch support was just as good as what I get from my Danskos or Brooks \u2014 which I wear daily at my hospital job where I\u2019m on my feet for 8+ hours.These didn\u2019t just survive the course \u2014 they thrived on it.

Dang I had to cancel the 7 and order the size 6. Reviews mention the shoe runs really big and to size down 1 or 1.5 sizes. The 5.5 was not available would have actually been perfect. The saving grace is that this shoe is not wide, so the narrow fitting allows me to wear with a bit more room in the toe.

From the moment I laced them up, I knew these shoes were going to be a game-changer, and they certainly proved their worth on the challenging trails.My primary requirements for hiking footwear are comfort and support, and these Adidas shoes delivered outstandingly on both fronts. The cushioning provides excellent comfort, absorbing the impact of each step, while the robust construction offers superior ankle and arch support, which is crucial for long days on the trail. One small note on sizing: I found that the sizing was a bit off, and I actually had to size down to get the perfect fit.I put these shoes through an extensive test, hiking between 8 and 11 miles each day through the rugged and rocky terrain of Estes Park. Despite the demanding conditions, my feet remained comfortable and well-protected. There was no slipping, rubbing, or discomfort, even after many hours of continuous use. The grip on the soles was exceptional, providing confidence on loose rocks and uneven surfaces.These shoes truly stood up to the challenge, proving to be incredibly durable and reliable. They not only protected my feet from the harsh ground but also contributed significantly to my overall enjoyment and stamina during the hikes.Overall, if you're planning a hiking adventure, especially one involving rocky or demanding trails, I cannot recommend these Adidas hiking shoes highly enough. They offer a perfect blend of comfort, support, and durability, making them an indispensable companion for any serious hiker.",

        "review": "Per many other reviews these shoes run really large. I normally wear an eight or an 8 1/2 in hiking and running shoes. The first pair I bought were eights which I thought would be small enough. They were huge. I returned those for a 7 1/2. I have wide feet and even the 7 1/2 is a smidge large. I ran out of time for a trip and kept them instead of trying an even smaller size. I have plenty of room in the toe box. I can\u2019t imagine these would work for anyone with narrow to maybe even moderately narrow feet. I also don\u2019t have much arch. I wear Hoka Gaviotas- if you have those you\u2019ll love these.  If you can find the right fit, these are very comfortable right out of the box and a great hiker. I hiked in Costa Rica in muddy and wet dirt and had zero issues. Grip and traction was great. There was no break-in needed-  no blisters or tired feet.  They cleaned up well. ( I do wish manufacturers would stop using white bottoms on hiking shoes. It\u2019s a given you\u2019ll be in brown dirt- why white?) I also wore these all day traveling and in airports. Seriously comfy shoe.  I wasn\u2019t a fan of the green color in the 8.5 - they looked a little garish. I wish all manufacturers had more neutral, natural colors.  I went to black in the second pair and much preferred that look albeit they\u2019re  a little boring. If you have feet like mine shoe shopping can be really frustrating. I went to REI and many other stores before giving up and going to Amazon. (Oddly I didn\u2019t find Hoka hikers comfortable. Too much arch) I do think it\u2019s worth trying to find the right size in these because in the end if you have wide flattish feet these are great for trails and even day to day. That\u2019s why I gave them 5 stars.One note- the rear pull strap is quite high.  While it didn\u2019t bother me a ton I can see how it might bother others.",

        "review": "These hiking shoes run larger than other brands, see my picture comparing them to several other brands I own that are the same size (size 8.) However, they are so comfy and my feet appreciated the extra room on my hike. My right foot typically can only stand a 45 minute hike before the ball of foot starts to throb and swell throbs. I took these out on a hour and 15 minute hike and only had mild pain. They performed very well on a variety of terrain. No slippage on sand, loose dirt, grass, or compact gravel, even in hills. There was minor slippage on loose rocksthat where about 1\"-2\" diameter when going downhill. The shoe also seemed to give my weak ankles more support. There was one point where I slipped slightly and felt my ankle wanted to turn, however the shoe prevented it. My old hiking shoes don't come up high enough on the ankle and my foot would have turned over for sure. If you're someone who has feet that ache and seem to swell when you hike, I would recommend sticking to your normal size. Otherwise you might want to size down. Personally, I'm glad they run a little big so my toes don't press against the shoe, which always seemed to happen when I'd walk down hills.

They were too big and I had to send back to get a 7. They are insanely comfortable and a perfect trail shoe when hiking boots are too much but tennis shoes aren\u2019t quite enough. These are more comfortable than typical trail running shoes and are a bit heavier. They have as good as or better traction and grip than other similar shoes (way more than OnClouds and about the same as Altra). They have a wide toe box and thick sole padding. They\u2019re a great hiking shoe or for walking off road or in mud and rain, as they\u2019re waterproof. Love them! They do look a little bulky on, so if that bothers you, you may want to look elsewhere.",

I have three other pairs of Adidas running shoes, two of them being 11's and one being 10.5. I also measured my heel to toe length and got between 10.5 and 11 inches, depending on if I am putting any weight on my foot or not. Based on this, I thought buying size 11 would be a safe bet. Once I put them on, I noticed the fabric above my big toe was a little tight when wearing them with socks on the thicker side, but not too uncomfortable. This may change as the insoles wear in. I was expecting there to be more room width-wise due to reviews stating that the shoes were very wide, but I did not find this to be the case. They seem to be on par with my other shoes, and I don't own any 'wide' sized shoes, but YMMV. If you are going purely off of the size chart, I would probably order a half to full size larger, but you can always return them and get another size. Overall, I like the shoes and will be ordering another pair, in size 11.5 this time, for when these wear out one day.",

Right out of the box, the shoes felt well made and durable, just as I'd expect from Adidas as I've owned lots of their shoes in the past. The design is sleek and sporty, with a slightly chunky, late 90s styled silhouette.The Cloudfoam cushioning is awesome, it feels like walking on a cloud, and helps me to be on my feet all day. The insoles have great contours and provide excellent arch support, which makes them comfortable for all-day wear. I even wore them on a long vacation with a lot of walking, and my feet felt great with no blisters. The shoes are also very lightweight while still offering solid support.The fit is true to size, but I did notice that they are a bit wider in the toe box, which is actually a plus for me. The lace up design allows for a more secure fit. While the toe guard felt a bit stiff at first, it broke in quickly and didn't cause any issues.Overall, these shoes are a perfect balance between comfort, performance, and everyday style.",

Very cute, and easily fits with many different outfits. We walked all day long, about 10 hrs each day. I was exhausted but my feet were happy!The outsole has nice curves to it, less impact but not too curvy like some sneakers are today.

I've always been able to count on them time and again to be well-made, with high quality fabrics and materials and this shoe is no different. They are lightweight, the insole is incredibly comfortable right out of the box. No break in time required. But for some reason, this style, the Astrastar is at least a half size to a full size larger than what I have always worn in an Adidas. I added some pics to compare to another Adidas I have that is also a size women's 9 1/2. So, though it's different for everybody, I would recommend sizing down in this style.

I walk in it and pretent it not that choked to my feet just because it so so beautiful.The outer sole is really bouncy and flexible, they soft and bend to your move. I love the sole.

They have a cushy EVA midsole and a rubber outsole that is more suited for urban wear than a typical soccer shoe, like the Samba. Arch support is good but not overdone. The Samoa's  are somewhat slept on in the Adidas Originals line, but are a fantastic shoe that pairs well with athletic or casual outfits and has clean, sleek lines.

To put them together in a sensible way costs extra for sure, that\u2019s a good value there.True, it doesn\u2019t fit as snugly as most other shoes we see, but counting on so many good and unique features of Avryn, it is a good model to have.Mine is the White/Zero Metallic.

I did research on good shoes for after the surgery and what is good to have, and for someone my age it mainly just seemed like having something with cushion and such that you didn't fall was most important.These shoes look great - I chose the black color as they're a bit more muted to suit my personal preference. These are wider with the soles which took a little bit of remeasuring to get used to when walking the first couple times, but then it was an afterthought. The cushioning is amazing! These are super comfortable. I've always been athletic until pretty much COVID, then the hip issue, and I've loved the Adidas brand, so have been perfect!These helped through the initial post-surgery steps, through physical therapy, through regaining my strength, and now with regular daily walking and whatnot.Definitely not waterproof, but perhaps waterproofing spray may help a bit. I live in the PNW so it rains when it's not the other season, but it hasn't bothered me yet.Bottom-line: Well-worth the purchase, definitely great for rehabilitation purposes, great for walking and stability.",

        "review": "This is my second pair of these shoes. I bought the first pair two years ago to take on a vacation to France and they were so good that this year I bought another pair, for you guessed it, another European vacation. What initially attracted me to these is that they are subtle yet comfortable. Yes, you can wear whatever shoes you want but in Europe, people tend to dress better, and their shoes are less flamboyant but still comfortable for hours and miles of walking. The purple is very subdued, and I have no problem wearing these just about anywhere. They're an ideal travel shoe because they are lightweight, breathable and supportive, all while being a fantastic value for the price. The name Ultrabounce conjures up thoughts of springy marshmallow comfort. I would say that's not entirely accurate. Yes, the shoes are comfortable but they are not crazy soft (like Hoka or some of the other super cushioned options out there)  and I think that's a good thing; they're cushioned enough to be comfortable but supportive enough to take care of your feet. What I also like about them is the way they fit. I have notoriously difficult feet to fit; I have narrow feet with high arches. While many companies are embracing the wider is better, especially in the toebox, these Adidas Ultrabounce runners have a welcomed medium to slightly narrow fit, perfect for me. In terms of size, I wear a size 12 in Nike and Asics; an 11.5 in Brooks and the 11.5 in these fit me perfectly. So why only 4 stars? I'm being picky, the insole is very basic and could do with more arch support; also, and this is a small thing, the laces are really long, they could be a little shorter. I worry that these will be discontinued, which would be a shame since they've become my go-to travel shoe and I bet that most people will appreciate them too. Buy them if you still can!",

Adidas actually made these in big sizes! I found no defects in the construction, or material of the shoes. The fit is very good, the ankle support is not there is you plan on using these for cross training. However when it comes to walking they are great. They are extremely light, I mean lighter than canvas sneakers while at the same time providing a lot more cushion. If you are not used to these types of walking shoes it does take a little bit of time to get used to. It literally feels like you are walking on a memory foam mattress at first. After a couple of days I started to break them in. They feel great on asphalt, concrete, gravel, and even some uneven terrain. The price was reasonable when compared to other walking shoes with similar padding and construction. If you want to take up walking I would recommend this pair.",

I don't know how long the bounce will hold up, but it is really nice to use these for walking or just wearing them all day.  The size is just right and they hug the foot well.  The only issue I have is that the rise on the back of the sneaker is just a bit too high for me.  When wearing no-show socks, the back of the sneaker rubs against the back of my foot and starts to get uncomfortable.  I am comparing these to a similar running show I have from Mizuno and I like the other one better due to the better shoelace design and lower rise on the back.

These are smaller feeling on his foot then his 5.5 old shoes. He also says they are narrow and squeeze his foot. He does not have wide feet, and we've not had that problem with shoes before. I do like the look of them on him, very cool on a eleven year old. They have a nice wide heel with good stability which is good since he has some pronation in his feet. Also he doesn't often wear sandals because of his pronation, so occasionally wears sneakers without socks in the summer. These are so scratchy inside that would not be comfortable with these. In the end these feel like a mid-quality shoe, but with good sole and support. The top feels a bit lower quality, and very scratchy.

        "review": "So I went down a rabbit hole to look for the PERFECT everyday sneaker and something that's robust and inexpensive as well. And let me tell you if you can find the right size for this shoe, it's well worth the hassle if the shoe FITS.Fit & Sizing:Now in terms of fit I unfortunately had to try THREE different sizing, to summarize- I'm normally a UK 9 (US9.5), and I saw reviews to size up but it was WAY too big for me, then ordered a size US9.5 which was OKAY, but I did the shove toes to the front of the toe box while seeing how many fingers I can put into the heel.. And it was 2 fingers (supposed to be 1 finger snugly). I tested it out walking for a whole day for about 4 miles walk and I didn't feel any fatigue from that. But the fit just felt a little off, that the heel still felt loose. I could still fit 2 fingers when doing that test. So finally I ordered a size US8.5 and YES it fits, BUT the joint above the toes (Metatarsal area) feels a little bit tight at the moment.I will update this review if it breaks in well and whether I was a lunatic to not stick with my true size. Will break in and update.Breathability:Shoes are fairly breathable. It is by no means a jogging shoe like running shoes but it's not suffocating. I'm hoping that this will be an all season shoe for me and this feels like a good balance  for this fall and hopefully the winter.Color:Ultimate dad shoe vibes- love the 90s classic aesthetic and texture (I got the Cloud White/Charcoal/Putty Grey), I'm happy this will pair with my minimalist outfits and I enjoy the simplicity of this colorway. If you're a uniqlo fan this shoe fits the bill pretty well with a lot of fits.Additional notes/Durability:Do note that I really went in the deep end to discover and research the perfect shoe not just for everyday use but also using this for occasional hikes too- because the sole is lugged (4.5mm) and it should be good for casual, occasional hikes. And also Adidas has a partnership with Continental I can attest from another a pair of Ultra Boost that these soles last a very long time. So it's amazing in terms of value- just behind VIBRAM but the shoes that have that technology tends to be a lot more expensive depending on model, around 100-200usd and above (like Hoka pricing). So I expect this shoe to last a long time.Conclusion:Don't sleep on this model, it's very underrated right now especially if it's on sale. Try it and be wary of the sizing problems. I'd say go for your true size and be prepared to go a size down, and disclaimer that everyone's feet is different.",

        "review": "I have narrow feet and heels usually have problems with shoes coming loose at the heel and ankle area. I purchased these based on some of the reviews that stated that these shoes ran small/narrow. The problem is that the elastic appearing band at the arch of the shoe is actually not elastic and appears to be more of a cosmetic touch. Even with my narrow feet, I had problems getting my foot into the shoe without a fair amount of effort assisted by a shoe horn. The band is relatively rigid and places a great deal of constriction in the midfoot area and along the inner arch of the foot. Once my foot is in the shoe, this constriction is very obvious and yet the heel/ankle area remain loose. This is a very non-anatomically sized shoe. The length appears to be true to fit, its just this midfoot band that is extremely uncomfortable. Also, the sole of this shoe is very stiff. It is not at all flexible unlike what you would normally expect in a casual slip on shoe. I was very disappointed as I liked the cosmetics of the shoe. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is one of the most uncomfortable shoes that I have ever purchased. I should have heeded the negative reviews that talked about how uncomfortable these shoes are. I just thought that it was because people had purchased the wrong size shoe. However, it is the construction and design of the shoe that makes it ill-fitting and uncomfortable. Perhaps that is why they are discounted so much. I have owned several pair of Adidas shoes (in the past they tended to fit well as they tended to accommodate narrower feet like mine). However, this is the first Adidas shoe style that I could not wear (in the proper 8.5 size) due to extreme discomfort. Again, quit a disappointment as I thought that I could snag a \u201cdeal\u201d as I really liked the sleek and clean look of the shoe. Will definitely be returning after just trying them on for 3-5 minutes.",

They are white, and slip on, but it gets pretty disappointing after that.The band on the side that is supposed to flex is more of a visual gimmick, which makes walking uncomfortable when it's combined with the shoe's unusual tight width.On the bright side- they'll stay clean for longer because I'll barely wear them. Realistically- I wish I had spent $10 more and gotten basic white shoes that I can wear without pain.",

Yes, it is true that whatever size you would wear( for example, I wear a women's size 7 and 1/2 so I knew to order a men's size 6) So yes, the reason that a lot of women are finding these running so big is because these are men's shoes! I will say this. They're super comfy and I actually even received him a day earlier was estimated. The quality is really good. The only real difference between the men's and women's is the toe box. As far as the height of it is a little roomier. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for some Adidas tennis shoes.

The padded collar gives serious ankle support, while the OrthoLite\u00ae sockliner molds perfectly to your foot and helps manage sweat. Even after full days of running and walking, my feet feel fresh and supported.\u2705 Reliable Build QualityThe synthetic leather upper is durable and wipes clean easily\u2014no peeling or fraying even after daily wear. The rubber cupsole balances firmness and flexibility, offering traction and durability all week long.\u2705 Versatile & Easy to StylePerfect for casual Fridays, weekend errands, or hitting the court.

I also bought a light grey pair a while back in a half size down (from a store, not amazon) and those fit the best of all 3 pairs I have. So overall, each color fits very differently and there is no consistency in quality. Very frustrating. They're super cute and I get compliments on them, but I won't buy adidas shoes again after this experience.Original review for black:When I first bought these I wasn't a fan. They were hard to put on without bending the back of the shoe, they weren't as comfy as my old cloudforms, and my usual size didn't fit. I am always a 9.5 in sneakers, but for these I had to return them and get a 10 because my toes were jammed in there. I got a shoe horn to help with puting them on, and that has saved me from a lot of pain. They are still comfy enough for every day wear, but I would not go walking miles in these. Even with these issues, I find myself wearing them often and choosing them over other tennis shoes because the material is high quality, the black color goes with everything, and they're super cute. Overall, I like them and bought another color, but I subtracted a star for the few issues I had to correct.",

Instead, it\u2019s made of elastic cool material that stretches when you insert your feet into them.  There\u2019s a flap that has laces like traditional shoes so you can further tighten them if it\u2019s still loose.  My daughter loves the fun girly color and says they\u2019re very comfortable.  The size runs slightly big so order down if your kids have smaller feet.Now for the not so good. The sole is more plasticky than grippy rubber.  I compare every shoes to Merrell since I consider them the benchmark.  Merrell use super soft grippy rubber soles.  In my opinion, it\u2019s not the best value for your money at $70.  Cross shop and consider Merrell as an alternative.",

        "review": "I ordered these Adidas Captor Flow 2.0 sneakers for my 10 year old niece knowing that school will be starting next month and she will want a new pair of sneakers. There are several color combos to order from and I debated about ordering the white with the fluorescent pink and yellow but white sneakers get so dirty and I knew they would be dirty in a week so I opted for the gray with purple combo.These sneakers are a tight knit, breathable mesh and the shoe is in one piece, no tongue, with man made leather eyestays with purple loops and tie laces. There is a high heel tab which makes putting them on a little easier although I have a pair of Adidas shoes with the high tab in the back and I needed to buy heel tab socks to prevent rubbing on the top of my heel, she wear ankle socks so it shouldn\u2019t be a problem. There is also a heel reinforcement as well as an extra rubber tab at the toes although she is rough on sneakers so I am not sure these will help. The inner sole is their patented Cloudfoam for cushioning and these shoes have a decent arch as well. The sole is white with a touch of purple to match the shoes and it\u2019s constructed of the typical foam soles you find in most sneakers these days, it feels hollow but it\u2019s a lightweight synthetic foam rubber.These shoes are nicely constructed and my niece really likes the style of this shoe, it\u2019s current and she even likes the grey and purple color combo  (she usually almost always picks out pink!). The price point is about average for brand name kids sneakers but these Kaptir Flow 2.0 sneakers are nice quality and my niece said they are super comfortable so the price is a good value. Overall, she gave them two thumbs up!",

She fell in love with the black and purple color combo (her two favorite colors!), and I love that the colors are not only pretty but also practical\u2014dirt and scuffs don\u2019t show easily.What makes these shoes stand out is the ease of use. Tying laces can be frustrating for my daughter on most days, and these slip-ons have been a game-changer. She can put them on independently, which gives her a boost of confidence and saves us all time and stress.As a parent, I was initially concerned about safety and grip, but these sneakers have great traction. The material is easy to clean, and even after a year of daily wear, they still look and perform great. Most importantly, they\u2019re comfortable enough for all-day use\u2014no complaints about foot pain, even with her low tone.The price point (around $50) is very reasonable for the quality. Honestly, I\u2019m just so happy to have found a stylish, functional, and budget-friendly shoe that works for her needs. I highly recommend for other parents navigating similar challenges.",

I got these for $65, which is a good price.  The colors look just like pictured online, and the bubblegum pink with the neon yellow/tennis ball green looks very cool and unique.

I can adjust the fit with the ample laces to accommodate mild swelling or a slightly thicker sock when needed. The padding of the foot bed is engineered for comfort and did not disappoint me. They also provide excellent stability and maneuverability as I can mildly feel contact with the ground. Some say there is not enough cushion in the foot bed but I found them to be a perfect walking shoe with all day comfort. This popular style matches almost any type of casual dress and I even wore them in the gym.  They aren\u2019t bulky and pack well so they are also a great travel shoe.

The coloration is great on these and they fit very well (although we ordered a size up for our son so he will grow into them.  They seem to be a great color that won't get too dirty too quickly, and can be washed easily.  They have nice padding to them as well which is great for running around and helping him.  I would say these are a great priced sneaker for your child, especially with the Marvel theme that they have going for them, which is awesome considering how inexpensive they are.  They come with a strap too so he doesn't have to tie them every time which makes it easy to get out the door.  Overall, the quality of these shoes is great and I would recommend them for anyone!",

The elastic laces and hook-and-loop strap make them super easy for him to put on and take off by himself, which is perfect for busy mornings.The fit is true to size, snug but not tight, and the cushioned EVA midsole provides lightweight support that absorbs impact, keeping his feet comfortable even after hours of running and playing. The rubber outsole is non-marking and grippy, making them safe for indoor and outdoor use.What I really appreciate is the quality and durability\u2014these sneakers feel well-made, and even after several weeks of daily wear, they still look and feel like new. The bright colors are fun and appealing, and they\u2019ve held up through playground adventures, running around, and casual wear. Overall, these sneakers are comfortable, durable, easy to wear, and perfect for an active child.",

They are a snug fit compared to Keen. There's quite some height added for shock absorption, which surprised him at first, but it adds to the comfort. There's good arch support and the quality is great. At 42 USD, these seem like a regular price for boys' sneakers with this level of arch support and durability. These are much easier than lace up shoes and just a bit more effort than Skechers slip-ins.",

She is able to easily put them on herself and found them to be comfortable.The reason form my three star rating is that they don't wear very long, they wind up looking very rough, after minimal wears (~10-15).  The construction is solid, but the fabric around the toe is like a felt, different than overall body and seems to get messy, discolored and pilling quickly.  I would recommend these shoes, but perhaps NOT in a lighter color.By the way - let's not label a shoe as \"boys\" just because it's blue.",

A lot of shoes are uncomfortable for me because my arches are low but these still feel good after an hour chasing my little one around the playground.I really like how the top of the tongue is cut so it doesn't press against my ankle, that really adds to the comfort.For kids, I prefer a wider toe box to make room for developing feet.

They\u2019re also incredibly lightweight, so my child runs around effortlessly. Most importantly, these shoes are durable and hold up to the normal wear and tear that comes with a toddler\u2019s active lifestyle.Cleaning them is a breeze\u2014they\u2019re easy to wash and air dry. I do recommend removing the insoles before air drying for best results. One important tip: avoid heat drying in the dryer as the plastic components can melt.The price point is surprisingly affordable, especially compared to similar options in stores. Overall, these shoes are a fantastic buy, and I highly recommend them for any parent with a busy toddler!",

The actual shoe underneath the fabric still seems to be holding up ok, so I guess more of a cosmetic issue, but still annoying.

I dont get packages at my residence because of problems with package theft so anything besides usps mail I have shipped to the CVS Pharmacy across the street and pick it up with my ID. Usually its perfectly fine, which leads me to believe this was a shipping problem. When I got the shoes home and opened the bubble wrap \"envelope\", which was already opened half way, the adidas box was demolished. My first thought was, \"oh no, my shoes are probably in shredded pieces\". The box literally fell in parts to the floor taking one shoe with it. I thought there would be absolutely no way the shoes made it in that box with no damage or stuff marks.Buuuut they did! Not a single scuff mark, dirty spot, frayed thread, or anything.

        "review": "I'm normally very rough on shoes. These have withstood 4 months with no fraying or broken laces. They're very worth the value in my opinion. I'm very impressed with the durability and functionality of the shoe. I will more than likely be buying these again, if the ones I got now ever do wear out, or I want a different color option.The shoes are definitely meant for runners/athletes. The aerated front portion of the shoes ensures that your foot maintains cover of airflow which substantially cuts down on smells from trapped perspiration. Obviously, ordering a size 15 tells you that I'm a big guy. However, the sole of the shoes has been outstanding. The heel portion does not leave me sore and the ball-of-foot portion does not leave me feeling like I have pins/needles in my foot after a run.I put them through the test of all tests for wearing shoes. They survived 4 days of 17,000+ steps in Walt Disney World parks (Orlando, Florida) during the day. No intention of throwing shade, but I purchased a pair of shoes from Disney Springs at a whopping $150 dollars that didn't make it past 7 months - it was a big brand that has celebrity collaborations!As far as shoes go, and I'm not just saying this because shoes are normally so expensive for me due to my size, these compare with a pair of Asics as far as comfortability and durability. They don't quite meet Merrill quality, but if they tweaked the materials they use for the sole without sacrificing price going with a Vibram sole, they could be very close.",

I wouldn't recommend for daily wearing, which is what I needed when I purchased these shoes, they're just not comfortable for me, but I will say, I'm a bigger guy, so that may be some of the reason. I will say though, I've had Nike shoes for years and daily wore them with absolutely no issues. I was actually replacing a pair of New Balance shoes with this pair, and after receiving this pair, I noticed immediately several differences, including the previously mentioned stitching, the weight was different, which I attributed to the different shoe model, but the logo was also different and looked as though it was screenprinted on and not a stitched on logo, which looked and felt cheap, almost like a counterfeit. I will say, the shoes have good grip, but I definitely feel it after wearing them all day. My feet stay tired most of the day while wearing these, but can't afford to replace them after only wearing for a few months. The problems with tired feet started day 1, so it's not a recent issue. They look good though and like I said, have good grip. I probably wouldn't buy them again, but I'm a unique situation, wearing them daily, all day, they might be better for working out or running, but for walking I wouldn't recommend. Very little support when it comes to foot sole support. I should say I purchased these on sale and I was able to receive them in 2 days, which was the main reason for my purchase.",

Straight out of the box, they felt incredibly comfortable the Fresh Foam midsole provides soft cushioning without feeling too squishy.The fit is true to size, and the upper mesh is breathable yet supportive, making it great for both walks and light workouts. What really stands out is how stable and balanced my feet feel, even after hours of wear.Whether you\u2019re standing all day, going for a run, or just need a dependable sneaker for daily use, this one hits the mark. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a durable and cushioned shoe without breaking the bank!",

        "review": "I ourchased a pair of these, locally, this Spring for my 12 year old son. By mid summer he had begun to grow out of them! I couldn\u2019t find a size 10 anywhere! Finally one came on here and I was able to secure it. You can take them to local DSW to have them water and dirt proofed. They are lightweight yet great quality and very comfortable. The material is soft cloth and the soles are thick and sturdy. Only thing I would say is deeper tread is needed for all shoe soles to ensure better grip. These do not come with waterproof protection so take them in. It\u2019s cheap to have done. He loves them and I will probably buy this pair again for future when he outgrows this one. He loves the color combo and they have great support for feet and legs.",

        "review": "I recently picked up the New Balance Men's Fresh Foam 680 V8 Running Shoe in the Angora/Arid Stone colorway, and it's been a fantastic addition to my footwear collection. The Fresh Foam midsole provides a plush, cushioned ride that's perfect for both my daily runs and casual walks. The engineered mesh upper ensures breathability, keeping my feet cool during workouts. I appreciate the neutral color palette, which makes the shoes versatile enough to pair with various outfits. While the shoe offers excellent comfort and support, I did notice that it runs slightly small, so I recommend considering a half-size up for the best fit. Overall, the 680 V8 delivers on comfort, style, and performance, making it a reliable choice for everyday wear.",

        "review": "Very comfortable. New balance shoes are predictably good shoes. They aren\u2019t what they used to be, in general. But these are well-made. I feel they run a little bit small, given that my last pair of shoes was new balance in the same size, comparing the two.The one issue is a design flaw in the toe, where an internal support causes the fabric on the top of the forefoot to wear quickly. But someone would have to look closely to see this. It hasn\u2019t affected the shoe\u2019s stability yet, and I am guessing the tread will wear out before the fabric does.",

They have a ton of cushion and look like they're made of top notch materials. These are replacing an old pair of Nike Air Max which I've had a long time but recently running they have been hurting my feet and shins so I thought it was time for something softer. I'm a month shy of 51 and by no means a pro runner, I've been running for 7 months and I do 1.2, 2.4 or 3.6 miles at a time usually a few times a week. That said, on the first 1.2 mile run I put them through, they felt much better than my old Nike's and I obliterated my personal best for 1 mile and total time (1.2 miles total). I am very happy with the price I got them for $55 Prime, but would say they are definitely worth the regular price of $79 as well. Have seen a few different colors go on sale from time to time on both Amazon and the NewBalance website for what I paid.",

I wear these for everything \u2014 running, long walks, even just daily errands \u2014 and they\u2019ve honestly become my favorite all-around shoe.The Fresh Foam X cushioning is the real deal. It feels soft but still gives me enough bounce, especially when I\u2019m putting in a few miles on pavement. There\u2019s no weird break-in period \u2014 they felt great right out of the box.What I noticed most with this version is the improved upper \u2014 it wraps around your foot more snugly without feeling tight. It breathes well too, which I appreciate here in Florida. My feet don\u2019t feel overheated even on long runs.I have slightly wide feet and went with the standard width, and they still felt roomy enough in the toe box. Sizing was true for me. The traction is solid too \u2014 I haven\u2019t had any slipping, even on damp sidewalks.If you're looking for a shoe that can handle real mileage but still feel great just walking around town, this is it. Yeah, they\u2019re not cheap \u2014 but for what they do, they\u2019re totally worth the price.",

Slightly rounded heel, rocker heel, caused me to step backwards at first to find my balance. Now I get it - this heel design creates a super fluid gait - remarkably smooth and gentle walking experience. The arch support is very good and feels perfect for easing my plantar fascitis. The cushioning is excellent - not squishy like crocs at all, just soft and comfy like no other shoe I've had.  Took a couple days for my hips and knees to adjust to being aligned properly but now I'm fully in love. Im able to walk longer and further than ever with no soreness anywhere just joy!

I love the fit and support of the Kaias and how they keep my feet and legs healthy. It took me a year to recover from shin splints after wearing the wrong shoes for too long (oops). The Kaias last for about 300 miles as the treadmill eats up the soles pretty badly, but I\u2019ll take to soft, flexible feel of the sole over a firm and unforgiving shoe any day. The sole is the only thing that ever shows wear and tear. Highly recommend if you\u2019re a like-minded runner.",

They appear to be helping so far, time will tell if they continue to deliver.So many shoes have gone to the Hoka-inspired massive, mushy sole and for me, those are not at all comfortable. I don\u2019t like how my foot strikes the ground and I don\u2019t feel the energy return from each step is optimal. THESE shoes, on the other hand, seem to offer a somewhat restrained fuller sole that gives some cushioning but still feels as though the physics of energy return are supporting your desire to walk with some speed/sense of urgency. Not sloppy at all. And it seems your feet hit the ground in a more natural, comfortable way.These look nice, too. I got the dark grey/black upper with while sole. Pretty understated vs screaming with color which is what I personally prefer.",

I originally bought them for light workouts and walking, but they\u2019ve quickly become my everyday shoes because of how comfortable and supportive they are.The cushioning is fantastic\u2014soft without feeling squishy\u2014and offers a nice bounce during workouts like walking, cardio, and strength training. What really stood out for me, though, is the arch support. I have slightly flat feet and often deal with foot fatigue, but these shoes give enough support to keep me comfortable, even during longer workouts or when I\u2019m on my feet all day.They\u2019re also really lightweight and breathable, which is great for the gym or just running errands. I\u2019ve had no issues with rubbing or blisters, and I didn\u2019t need to break them in at all. I went with my usual size and the fit was spot-on, with a bit of extra room in the toe box.If you\u2019re looking for a versatile sneaker that works for both fitness and everyday wear\u2014and especially if you need decent arch support\u2014I highly recommend these. New Balance really nailed it with this one.",

The Dynasoft cushioning feels plush underfoot, making it perfect for all-day wear. Whether you\u2019re hitting the gym or running errands, these shoes provide great support without sacrificing comfort.Fit: These cross trainers fit true to size, but they have a slightly snug fit, which is great for those who prefer a more locked-in feel. However, if you have wider feet, you might want to consider going up half a size. The slip-on design with a lace-up front gives it a sleek look while ensuring a secure fit.Design: The all-black design is sleek and versatile, making it easy to pair with any workout gear or casual outfit. The minimalist aesthetic is modern, and the subtle branding keeps the look clean and stylish.Performance: The Dynasoft Nergize V2 is excellent for a variety of activities, from light workouts to everyday wear. The traction is good on most surfaces, and the shoes offer a nice balance of flexibility and stability. However, for more intense workouts or running, you might need something with more specialized support.Durability: After a few weeks of use, the shoes show minimal signs of wear. The materials used seem durable and should hold up well over time, though the lightweight nature might not offer the same longevity as more robust trainers.Conclusion: Overall, the New Balance Women\u2019s Dynasoft Nergize Sport V2 Cross Trainer is a solid choice for anyone looking for a comfortable, stylish, and versatile shoe. It\u2019s perfect for low-impact workouts, walking, or just everyday wear. While it may not be the best option for high-intensity training, it excels in everyday comfort and style.",

I like the traction because I work on slippery polished floors that are frequently wet.I\u2019ve been wanting a pair of black shoes for quite a while and I\u2019m so happy I found these. I definitely recommend them - BUT - order a little larger than your normal size.",

        "review": "Apparently the corporate agenda has taken over New Balance footwear. These shoes are made of cheap material all over, like every piece of them.Let me explain, the top of the toe is flimsy and offers no support. It\u2019s like wearing a plastic bag on your foot. I\u2019ve actually worn plastic bags on my feet when I was a kid playing in the snow. We used to wear them under our winter boots so our toes didn\u2019t get soaked after the whole day of winter fun. These shoes feel pretty much the same as just the bag. No support at all, anywhere.If you haven\u2019t worn bags on your feet like me, maybe you\u2019ve tried on a pair of water shoes. They\u2019re about as supportive as water shoes. The  toe box doesn\u2019t exist. Side to side support doesn\u2019t exist. And the heel box is almost nonexistent. I mean it\u2019s there, (heel box), but for a company like New Balance to be selling shoes this cheaply made is not what I\u2019m used to from this brand. This company used to sell shoes that gave you.. well, good balance. Their shoes passed the twist test, were made of leather, and had support every where you wanted it, and even where you didn\u2019t know you needed it.The tongue is tiny, and bunches up between the lace holes exposing your sock from the top of the shoe. Not good.Laces came untied multiple times the two times I wore these.Nonslip capability\u2026well, they are somewhat nonslip. But I always use nonslip shoes, and out of my last 5 pairs, these are the worst non slip soles I\u2019ve had. You can tell they\u2019re better than a regular running or hiking shoe sole, but hoka, keen, doc Martin, sieka, and crocks, are all way better and safer.I would say a fair price for these shoes would be about $19.99.I\u2019m looking back at this review and feeling so bad because it\u2019s so negative. But really if you get these shoes you will see for yourself. I do plan on getting the upgraded version of these nonslip. They\u2019re almost twice as expensive, but hopefully they\u2019re worth it.",

I could tell when I put them both on one after the other (despite both being labeled as 6mm drop).The v5 wide seems a touch wider in the forefoot than the v4 wide, which is good for me.  I feel like the heel fits better on the v5 than the v4  (my heel is narrow-ish btw).  The v5 is also noticeably more comfortable overall to my foot.The TPU plate gives you decent bounce to your step and yet a stable feeling while the foam is still very soft & comfortable.  Very good combination.My only complaint is that there could be maybe a touch more space where my big toe goes on my right foot only (my right foot is a hair longer than my left it seems based upon my past experience with shoes).  There seems to be just a touch less space (either length, width, or height) at this precise exact spot in the v5 than there was in the v4, because I did not experience this sensation at all in the v4.Overall though, great quality for the price, there's no doubt.",

I did replace the laces as I dont car for NB laces in general (tend to stretch to much for my liking).

These shoes have exceeded my expectations.First and foremost, the comfort level is off the charts. From the moment I put them on, it felt like I was walking on clouds. What's even more impressive is that there was absolutely no break-in period required. I wore them straight out of the box, and my feet were great from the get-go.One of the standout features for me is how incredibly lightweight they are. It feels like I'm hardly wearing shoes at all. This makes them perfect not only for running but also for everyday wear. Whether I'm hitting the pavement or just going about my daily activities, these shoes provide the support and comfort I need.Another huge plus is how breezy and cool they keep my feet, even during warm weather. The ventilation in these shoes is top-notch, and it really helps in preventing that uncomfortable sweaty feeling. My feet stay cool and fresh throughout the day.And let's not forget about style. These shoes are not only functional but also incredibly stylish. I've received compliments on their sleek design, and they easily pair with both athletic wear and casual outfits. They're versatile enough to suit any occasion.In conclusion, the New Balance Men's Fresh Foam Roav V1 Running Shoes are a winner in my book. They check all the boxes for comfort, style, and ease of wear. If you're looking for a pair of running shoes that deliver on every front, look no further.

They are trail shoes and provide great traction and generally keep crap out of my socks and the shoes.  I probably have 100 miles on them now and they've held up well.  Only downside is the lace \"system\", the laces drop through the eyelets to a cord loop that makes adjusting them a bit of a pain.

Too hard to keep clean!! LOL..And, sometimes I would even complain \u2013Hey! New Balance! Love your sneakers!! But can you please stop with the new model numbers every few weeks? Good Lord! The 608s became 623s, and on and on!!Hey, New Balance!!! I just want a pair of sneakers, not a Bingo game!! LOL..Anyway, I went shopping on Amazon for a new pair of New Balance sneakers.. No white.. I wanted a pair with some color that would not need to be scrubbed with a \u2018Mr. Clean Magic Eraser\u2019 every time I walked on my lawn to fill the birdfeeder..And I saw these sneakers..New Balance Dynasoft Tektrel V1 Trail Running Shoes..And I fell in love!New Balance was offering them in a variety of colors, but the \u2018Black Phantom Magnet\u2019 color really appealed to me, so I took a chance and ordered a pair..Couple of notes \u2013** I ordered these on December 12, and they just came on February 4.. But they were worth the wait!** Fit is -as always from New Balance - as expected!** Superb quality materials and construction, as always!** My pics cannot do these sneakers justice.. They are simply wonderful, and they look great \u2013 even out of the box before I bothered tying the laces!!** I cannot rate their performance on a hiking trail yet, but the \u2018design of the soles\u2019 on these sneakers looks to be \u2018aggressive\u2019 enough to handle many different surfaces, providing excellent traction while also providing support and comfort to the foot..** The \u2018lacing structure\u2019 of these sneakers is really cool!! The laces lace up at both the \u2018tongue\u2019 of the sneaker and the sides of the sneaker all the way down to the top of the sole.. The whole thing looks nice and I would imagine also provides extra support..Bottom Line \u2013 I highly recommend these sneakers! Another great product by the legendary New Balance! 5 Stars!!!",

Right out of the box, the design caught my eye. New Balance really nailed the aesthetic on these\u2014they look sleek and trail-ready without being overly bulky. It's a shoe that performs well and looks good doing it.When it comes to fitting, these shoes truly shine. They hug my feet comfortably, providing a secure and supportive feel that's crucial on uneven terrain. My feet feel locked in without being constricted, allowing for confident strides whether I'm climbing or descending. The cushioning feels just right, absorbing impact without sacrificing responsiveness.And the price? Absolutely spot on. I feel like I got a premium trail running shoe without breaking the bank, which is always a win. My only minor critique, and it's a small one, is that they're a little tight on the side of my feet. While the overall snugness is a positive, I do notice a slight pressure on the sides after longer runs. It's not a deal-breaker by any means, and I'm hoping they'll loosen up just a touch with more wear. Despite that minor quibble, I'm genuinely thrilled with my New Balance trail running shoes. They're a comfortable, stylish, and affordable option for anyone looking to hit the trails with confidence. I highly recommend them!",

I'm an older runner and need the cushioned shoes for the down hills. But these have a much better outsole like a proper trail runner should have. Not quite as wide as the X More Trail V3 but it does not seem to be an issue. I may edit this after 250 miles to say how well they are wearing. I have 416 miles on the X More Trail V3 and they are still comfortable but they are wearing out a little but I think these should last as long or longer.",

        "review": "I have two pairs of this shoe, I bought my first pair after trying them on in a store and I immediately loved the way they felt. I bought my second pair (pictured) from Amazon because the colors are nice, and I needed another pair to use exclusively outside of work. I'm very tempted to buy a few other colors. My other pair is black and white, and I appreciate how the black is slightly purple and the white is slightly grey. Anyway, it's great these shoes caught my eye because they don't just look good. The soles have a soft cushiony feeling and the uppers live up to their name: \"FantomFit.\" They are my favorite shoes for 12 hr shifts as a bedside RN, setting PRs in 1mi and 5k, and going out for food, drink, etc. Although these shoes are cushy, they are also responsive and fast. When running shorter distances I simple don't think much about them and they help me do my thing and yes it's in these shoes I broke my records for 1mi and 5k despite owning carbon shoes Nike Vaporfly 3 and Fuelcell Supercomp Elite v3. Probably because I'm more likely to take these shoes out daily. There are however two things I don't like about these shoes: 1) the upper material seems prone to abrasion, and 2) I'd get sore on long distance. I washed my 1st oair once and used a brush on the upper of the right shoe, little broken fabric filaments are now visible all over the upper hence I simply did not scrub the left one. In general both my pairs do not show much signs of other wear so I think the main thing is to not scrub the uppers. My second issue is that I could run more than 17.3 miles in these shoes. I had bad upper foot pain on two of my long runs in training for my first marathon in December 2024. I suspect, the upper foot pain may have been caused by form modifications from other pain on my soles then knees. Because of this the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 won the toss-up for my marathon shoes. With that said, 17.3 miles is quite a long distance already and there could have been other factors that may have contributed to my pain. I must mention that the Adios is a dedicated road-running shoe and is more expensive. I wouldn't want to work a 12 hour shift in them because they feel funny when not running. I also must mention that these shoes are awesome on the treadmill as well as the road/sidewalk. While $140 isn't cheap, I consider it a good value for how good they are and how how they compare to more expensive shoes.",

Whether I\u2019m doing an easy run or throwing in some tempo miles, these shoes handle both without missing a beat. The upper is breathable and hugs the foot well without feeling restrictive, which is especially nice on warmer days.Traction is solid on both pavement and light gravel paths, and after a few weeks of daily use, the outsole is holding up well.

        "review": "Historically New Balance only makes certain shoe models with their extra wide sizing.  The retro/fashionable models haven't usually been included in that bucket.  So when I saw these new 515's on my BIL's also wide feet and saw them being offered with this many colorways, on Amazon, for less than $100, it seemed too good to be true.I know I'm writing this like I'm about to bring up a big \"but\" with these shoes...  But I'm actually not.  They're actually extremely well made, breathable in the summer heat and surprisingly comfortable, even with just an EVA midsole and thin hard rubber outsole.  I'm also one of those weird goth kids from the 90's who proved it wasn't just a phase, so the minimalist blacked-out colorway also gave me a bit of the fizz.  The wider 4E fit and footprint is also identical to what I'm used to with my other New Balance faves (the 410v5 dark Trail Runners) but the materials feel even more substantial and quality.  Though I will admit that the sole response of the 515's is less springy and athletic-feeling than those kicks.That said, I've been wearing these shoes a LOT this summer and they haven't disappointed yet.  The leather has held up and stayed clean with no fraying at the seams or obvious signs of wear inside or out.  The midsole has well broken into the shape of my foot and toes, providing a decent amount of support and grip without looking agressively athletic.  Which seems to leave the 515's striding a happy line between looks and functionality that have made them my go-to running around town shoes going forward.If you have wide feet, you could do a lot worse.",

Surprise, surprise, they fit perfectly, my feet hurt way less, and I don't look like Quasimodo Frankenstein after having broken them in. No blown out sides and I might just try the \"extra wide\" option next buy. Thanks for offering \"Wide\" options and sizing options higher than 12, and at an affordable price New Balance and Amazon!",

I do tons of walking but don't drag my feet so the soles don't wear fast and I don't let them get wet, but it was time to get a new pair. These new ones are perfect in every way, absolute comfort, roominess, but snug enough fit with a good amount of comfort padding inside, and they have the exact size dimensions of the last size 15's I had from 5 to 6 years ago, maybe a slight tad wider for even better comfort. I love that they don't pronate (tilt to one side from overly spongy soles) and are even more stable for the ankle than the last ones. They also don't have excessive heel height which is a huge problem for me in this trend of making heels too high since i have ankle issues and had to have surgery on my feet at age 4, so I was told my my orthopedic doctor my feet could not handle excess sloping, i.e., higher heels. In this regard, it reminds me of barefoot shoes with a flatter more even profile, but still with good arch support and still perfect shock absorbing comfort (not excessive since I can't handle excess arches). Glad I came across the perfect fit shoe for me, though there is one thing I hope will last and that is four of the shoelace eyelets in the middle were done differently for stylistic reasons: they are put through some type of fabric loop instead of the leather that the other holes are made to go through. If those loops have stitching that fails at some point then one would have to resort to drilling a hole into the leather where it normally would go through because they had to do this \"cool\" looking style feature. Who knows, maybe it will last okay. The price is great too, and hope they don't read this and raise it!",

I have a straight lasted, narrow foot; very neutral gait; normal arch and no structural or biomechanics abnormalities other than boney ankles. I bought these NB Hierro trail shoes in the low cut version and they turned out to be my favorite trail shoes ever! And they have great durability - after a year and a half of regular use, they\u2019re still going strong (I alternate several pairs of shoes at a time to extend their mileage), but I\u2019m soon ready to retire them to be yardwork shoes. So I wanted to try these with a slightly higher ankle to keep the dirt & debris out better. I was a bit nervous because my ankles are so boney, so high tops often dig in. But these don\u2019t! \ud83d\udc4fThese are truly waterproof and have a gusseted tongue. They\u2019re very comfortable, responsive and cushioned - every bit as responsive and cushioned as the low cut version. They\u2019re light weight and very grippy, but you can still feel the road/trail for agility. And I really love the colors! It\u2019s a very cold gray, almost blueish grey. The lavender with dark pink accent colors are beautiful. They aren\u2019t too dark to wear in the summer, and they\u2019re attractive without being too bold so they don\u2019t clash with most outfits. These aren\u2019t nearly as hot as my winter hiking boots that are actual hiking boots and not just high top trail shoes. It\u2019s so nice to have both!There\u2019s only two negatives, which the low cut ones don\u2019t have. The toe shield on these is just leather, not hardened for extra protection like the low cut version. And you do have to be careful about how you lace these because the tongue is just barely wide enough, and something can dig in if you don\u2019t get it just right. I rethreaded one hole on the left shoe from under to over, and it\u2019s much better.I still wear Nike Vomero\u2019s on the road, but these are my favorites for the trails! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70",

There were lots of puddles, mud, and lots of places to slip.Tested water resistance when I sank into a muddy puddle. My foot got wet, but dried quickly. The traction was good when we had to cross large puddles on wobbly fallen branches.My feet stayed cool throughout the whole hike! I was impressed, even when it was pretty hot and humid out.Overall, these shoes are everything I needed them to be; cool, comfortable, cute, and supportive of my ankles and feet.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Original:I\u2019ve been on quite the hunt for a shoe that offered good ankle support, that\u2019s breathable for the summer, and something at least semi-cute. In the world of hiking, cute is not in the manufacturer\u2019s vocabulary\u2026 at least nothing that is reasonably affordable. I\u2019m pleased that these check all those boxes.I ordered these in a half size larger and in wide since I read several reviews about these being tight all over. The half size and width make these very comfortable and allow me to add thick socks for wetter and colder seasons! So plus!Bought these for an upcoming camping trip where there will be light hiking, but being pregnant, I need breathable shoes for the humid Texas heat. Haven\u2019t had a chance to test them out yet, but will update me them after I get a chance to put them to the test.It\u2019s worth noting that the rim of the ankles are stiff and does need to be broken in.

Where do I begin\u2026\u2026First off, the shoes came in a generic (non New Balance) box which means they\u2019ve previously been returned.Not a good sign.Tried them on and they were super uncomfortable around the ankles, very stiff and felt like I was being jabbed. Tied them somewhat loosely to see if that helped, it did not. \u00a0Maybe they need to be broken in?? With this in mind I figured I would give them a fair shot and test them out. Put them on with boot socks and got on the treadmill.NOPE. Less than 5 minutes and I couldn\u2019t stand it. Felt like I was doing the Frankenstein/Herman Munster walk. Super stiff all around, not just at the ankle.Normally a huge New Balance fan so I am extremely disappointed. Definitely going to return them.",

The quality of the materials is excellent, perhaps other than the shoe laces that are just standard.  The fit, I wear an 11.5 wide was very nice.  I would say they may run slightly large, and by that I mean length, not width.  At any rate they are an excellent fit.  However the premium part of these shoes for me is the density of the sole.  Often shoes are described as walking on clouds but to me that means overly soft, these shoes have a firmness and give combination that is extremely comfortable for me.  I\u2019m shocked at how good they feel.  One small note just to be fair, the insoles in these are suprizingly minimal.  I\u2019ll probably replace them with something else.  Also the drop, that\u2019s the difference in the height of the heel and the forefoot feels like 0 which I like a lot,  some running shoes have a huge drop and feel like you are walking downhill.  I like these much better.  Hope this helps.  Oh one more thing, they are expensive but I\u2019m sure I\u2019ll get enough wear out of their quality to make up for the cost.",

I wear 12EE in the classic New Balance styles (574? Something like that). But these are smaller in the foot opening as well as narrower than that style/cut of shoe. So 13 EE fits perfectly, I can slide my foot in and out without untying, and the shoe isn't gonna fall off.They are very light and comfortable, especially after loosening the laces.I don't think these would hold up to major abuse or running, but as a casual sneaker for around town, I think they'll do just fine. I also don't think you should be jumping in puddles in these shoes either, else you'll be left with some very wet feet\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02",

        "review": "This is my first pair of New Balance running shoes. I've been running for over 15 years and have mainly stuck with Asics and Brooks as my primary trainers. Obviously the 520's are a budget pair of running shoes and are not going to be as nice or as durable as a more expensive flagship pair, but I've purchased many $40-60 Asics and these are fairly comparable. The 520 v8's are very light shoes with a neutral fit and a smooth tread. They make excellent racing shoes, but aren't a great option for longer distances. These shoes feel very stiff to me, more so than any of my Asics within this price range ($54). But take that with a grain of salt as my other pair of shoes right now are the Hoka Mach 5's ($160) that are by far the most comfortable, cushy shoes I've ever had. These are a great light shoe for runs under 5-6 miles at a time. I've found they start to lose cushion and get pretty hard after that. I tried a half marathon in these and wished I would have brought a second pair for the second half. They started to feel hard around mile 6 and by mile 8-9 they'd lost all cushion.In terms of longevity, I don't see these shoes making it much past 250miles. But again as a budget pair, that stacks up to the competition. I've been able to average around 300 miles in my \"cheaper\" Asics. They now have 100 miles on them, and so far they've visibly held up well, but already have a permanent crease in the mid-sole. The tread is holding up great with slight wear on the toe. The mesh, laces, and even the interior are all holding up well with no wear holes in the heel. (Like every pair of Asics get) I do have some light staining on the mesh / outside of the shoe, but of course being such a light color that's going to happen with outdoor running in the winter. I actually prefer these shoes for outdoor running over the treadmill. They're light and feel great as a fast shoe, but they're just lacking cushion for long runs or treadmill running. I also second the review talking about long laces. These shoes have the longest laces I've ever had on a pair of shoes. I mean annoyingly long; but you could always replace them easily. So far I've enjoyed these shoes enough to own another pair of New Balance running shoes, but my next \"budget\" pair will be Asics again.",

The shoes are highly ventilated and breathable, not to mention extremely light, bouncy, and fast! I do have some gripes with the seller, though. I ordered from Fast Goods and when they got to me, there was only the inner box portion, no lid, and it was beat up pretty badly. I could definitely tell the shoes had been tried on/worn, and were certainly a return or a regret for somebody else. I loved them so much, though, and got them at such a great price, that I was willing to keep them despite all that. I just didn't find it very professional of the seller to sell them as \"brand new\" when they really weren't, so be aware of that. I couldn't find the rose and white colorway elsewhere or at such a good price, so I cut my slight losses on brand new shoes and kept them, because they are truly a comfortable and amazing shoe.

Most I either tried on in the store or purchased and wore for a few minutes before returning. Others I thought worked until discovering after a few weeks that they weren't right. I have metatarsalgia and Morton's Neuroma in one foot and have tried the shoes recommended by foot specialists. I need wide shoes for both toe box room and metatarsal comfort not constricting the outer edge of my foot. However, all these shoes resulted in some ball of foot soreness. I do Jazzercise, which involves jogging in place, jumping, lunging, balancing on one foot, and plenty of other footwork. It's important that my weight be placed primarily in the heel and arch to minimize impact to my forefoot. Only the FuelCell Rebel V3s have resulted in zero soreness during and after a class. They are light and springy to boot. When I stand for a long period, I am aware that there is no pressure on the ball of my foot or toes (and why I don't feel pain or soreness). In fact, I had to wear a pair of fancy stage shoes last weekend that hurt my foot. Afterwards, I put on these NBs, and my foot felt better within minutes. I've worn them for the past three weeks and want to purchase another pair. I only intended to wear these shoes to workouts but find myself in them almost daily because my feet feel so dang good.",

My husband, for example, wears a NB 1080. I could never wear that model. The shape of the shoe is way different. I buy men's shoes because they are wider than women's.

The size seems to run 1/2 size smaller as I found the arch of this shoe pressing against my heel leaving me feeling like I want to slide my heel rearward in the shoe.  The foam in the shoe is squishy and leaves footing feeling unbalanced and unstable.I will be looking for new brand of shoes as New Balance seems more concerned with introducing new features to sell shoes instead of providing a product that is good for customer.",

These fit the bill, being able to accommodate both and affording a decent amount of lateral stability compared to others. Most importantly, I can get the carbon plates and orthotics into these and still get a decent heel lock without having to ratchet down the laces. I other words, the depth in the heel is great as well s the amount of cushion in the heel stay. I wish more shoes had a similar build to afford such a great fit in the heel when custom orthotics and such are in the mix.That said, the toe box could be a bit wider up front,  like a more natural foot shape (and ideally a straighter last on the outside of the mid foot. The New Balance Kaiha Road feels better in the lateral mid foot area, and is cushy, but lacks the lateral stability that this shoe provides). The heel could be more stable laterally, but it's better than a host of others I have tried and checks all the major boxes for my needs. e.g., The Hoka Bondi 8 is more stable laterally, but lacks the heel lock with the carbon plate and orthotics in the mix.",

New Balance is one of those brands.  Consistently reliable fit, always comfortable footbed, and made of durable and eye-catching materials.  This 680v3 is no exception.  The cushioning and construction support the foot well despite the workout load.  The toe box is sufficiently roomy.  Cushioning under the heel pocket and the metatarsal is substantial, yet it retains good motion control (lateral) for varied activities.  Removable footbed allows for orthodicts or foot beds with more cushioning.  But I have to say, this sneaker was comfortable right out of the box.  I use this pair for intense elliptical training and have enjoyed their support, construction, and good looks for 2 months now.  Great shoe!  Highly recommend!",

You generally find something that's comfortable and available, and stick with that brand and size. For me, it's been New Balance 14 extra wide for the last 20 years or so (yes, I'm a dad, and old). This has been fine for sneakers, and I even got a pair of NB hikers that have been working pretty great for me.My family and I love the beach, and every time we find ourselves shopping at the beach, I instinctively check the flip flop rack for something in a 14. To this day, I've never seen anything on those racks above a 13. So I went to Amazon, found a nice looking pair of flip flops, and the largest size they had was a 14. Figuring I could return if it didn't fit, I pulled the trigger. When I got them, I couldn't even get my toes past the straps. There is no way they were bigger than a 12!So I continued shopping the Amazon, and lo and behold, these New Balance slides showed up in my search results. Thinking they've never steered me wrong in the past (and I could return them again if they didn't fit), I decided to buy these in 14 X-wide.Like a lot of people said, they definitely need some breaking in. I just wore them around the house with socks on (never with socks in public though) for a few days, and they feel amazing now. I generally don't leave reviews this quickly, because I like to see how they hold up after a few months, but so far, so good. They feel relatively sturdy, and given how quickly I destroy shoes (I'm a big, active guy), I'll be happy to get two summers out of these, and with what I've seen so far, I don't think they'll disappoint.",

I should note that I weigh 195; and as such, prefer a shoe with a little more cushion. (Not that it needs to be like a pillow; but I find thinner/harder insoles uncomfortable).I was going to return these shoes; but I purchased some insoles (around $20) that provide much more cushion. Perhaps a guy who weighs less would find these shoes comfortable as is, with a thinner/hard insole; but I did not.Now that I have the softer insoles instead of the hard/thin insole that came with this shoe; I find this shoe very comfortable.I also like the square/boxy toe box; which gives my toes plenty of room, rather than a more tapered shoe that narrows at the toes.These shoes cost much less than many of the running shoes available. (Which is nice). However, be aware that if you are not a light-weight guy; you may need to spend a little more money to buy some softer insoles to put in these shoes.",

They fit true to size and are very comfortable.The ridges under the toes took a little bit of getting used to, but after wearing them for a while I\u2019ve found they actually help keep the sandal in place. I mostly wear these around the house, and they provide a surprising amount of arch support \u2014 which is rare for sandals \u2014 so they\u2019re comfortable for extended wear. The suede-like material wipes clean easily if you spill something on them, and the stitching feels very solid.

I went to my local New Balance shoe store, they said that everyone was unhappy with this and that I should call NB customer service.  After half an hour on hold, New Balance Customer Service told me that they do not solve shoelace problems, and that the problem is all mine.  The shoes come with too-small laces in 2 different colors (how special is that!).  It is costing me an additional $15 to order replacement shoelaces on Amazon, while taking my best guess at the right size to order.  I asked NB Customer Service to at least document the fact that their product has a problem, and the agent seemed overwhelmed at the effort that this would require.  With a $199 price tag, something here should really be handled a lot better.  Any chance that someone up there will read this?Footnote:  I bought the extra shoe laces, and now I really hate these shoes.  There is a huge amount of shoelace showing (is this supposed to be decorative?), and I prefer a shoe which is less shoelace, and more shoe material.  New Balance seems to have considered this, by providing 2 pairs of shoe laces - one white and one navy.  Theoretically, the navy laces would be less visible.  Unfortunately, the shoe has a white piping around the lacing area, so the navy laces just look dumb.  Use the white laces, which will never stay white, and they cover 1/3 of the shoe's front.",

These are stability shoes, if you need stability while running, to the point that a 1 pound shoe will help, then by all means by them.I use them to work in. My ankles tend to roll, and have never had a more durable shoe!! These shoes are tanks! It\u2019s like having the armor around your feet. I\u2019ve worked in them for 2 years at a job 10 hours a day, 4 x\u2019s a week and they look like they\u2019re new. They\u2019re hard as all get out, look like something Herman Munster would use, but no ankle movement and you are stable like you\u2019ve never been. Don\u2019t get them to run. Get them if you\u2019re not that stable walking around.",

        "review": "I have been wearing the 1540 and its predecessors for nearly 20 years. I have gone through at least 30 pairs. Before this one there was the 1122 and the 1121, both in various v versions. Once before, a new version was bad. The product got bad reviews and sales tanked. They then quickly fixed the problems and came out with a v2 version. This shoe series, along with Brooks \"The Beast\", are the 2 best shoes for people who may have planter fasciitis, use orthotics, are overweight and/or over pronate. It is built on the New Balance S2 last which produces a straight lasted shoe with extra room in the toe box. The extra room in the toe box is a big deal for people with diabetes, neuropathy, bunions, etc.I wear these shoes every day. I keep 3 pairs in service, wearing each pair every 3 days. This allows the foam in the soles to re-expand between wearings and keeps the foam soft and cushiony much longer. I put a new pair of shoes into service every 18 months, replacing the oldest pair with new ones.I could see immediately that the 1540v3 is a whole new design from the v2. I put on the shoes and wore them around the house all evening. I immediately noticed that the shoes do not have that wonderful, soft cushiony feel that I am accustomed too with a new pair of this series of shoes. The soles are much harder and have less cushioning. The main reason I replace these shoes is when they no longer have enough cushion in them. I can tell, because my feet will to hurt badly at the end of the day. So to start out with new shoes that already have hard soles is a non-starter for me.The second thing I noticed with the v3 is that I am feeling hard pressure points through the arch support area and also along the outside edges of the shoes. I think this is caused by the combination of my orthotic inserts and the harder soles of the shoes. The pressure points were bad enough to make my feet sore after wearing them around the house for a few hours. This is also a non-starter for me.The shoes also have completely re-designed outer soles and the shoes have a more solid feel when you plant your foot and walk forward. The shoes resist rolling to the inside or outside more than the v2s. I like this more solid feel, but time will tell whether this increases or decreases foot comfort.The length of this shoe is exactly the same as the v2 model. The toe box of the v3 has a little more room in it and feels less tight on the toes. The front of the v3 toe box now points inward a little unlike the v2 model which pointed straight ahead. This crowds the outside of the toes a little and could be a problem for people who have bunions. Bunions shift the toes towards the outside of the shoes and crowd the toes against the outside of the shoes. I do have small bunions, but with the wider toe box on the v3 model, I don't think it would be a problem for me. I think this change was made to make the shoes look more stylish, but could decrease comfort for some wearers.The shoes have more padding along the sides and rear of the ankles which makes them more comfortable in those areas.  I really like the new styling and colors of the gray and blue shoes. The uppers seem to be made of stronger, more durable materials that would resist staining.  These are all nice improvements. The main thing I have disliked about the previous models is that they seem to wear out to quickly for a shoe in this price range. The soles lose their cushioning and the outer soles seem to be made of a soft rubber that wears away too quickly, especially in the heels. Time will tell whether the v3's will last any longer.Because of the lack of cushioning in the soles, these shoes no longer work for me. I am going to try out a pair of the Brooks Addiction 14 which worked out pretty well for me when New Balance ruined the 1122 model some years ago. I  may also try out a New Balance 840v4 model. If others also find the soles too hard on the v3 model, we may be seeing a v4 coming out soon. In the mean time, I will be keeping my eye out for v2 shoes in my size and color.Update on July 2, 2021: I just saw an announcement that the 1540v4 shoes will be released in Oct. 2021. This, the V3 version, will start to show limited size availability and, shortly before the V4 is released, will be offered at big discounts. I hope the V4 goes back to a softer sole like the V2 version has. If so, I will likely start wearing them again. In other aspects, it is a very good shoe.",

        "review": "Based on the sizes shoe companies now market, I must have rare narrow feet. So most of the shoes I've bought for the past few years have been way too wide for me.  Finally found these New Balance shoes in narrow width!  First shoes in years that are comfortable and stable!  Beyond that, they're well-made and look pretty good.  The relatively low stack height and minimal drop also contribute to their stability. If you prefer the super cushy type where you have no feel for where the ground is, you should probably try something else. But if you want fit and stability, try these.a",

Over a few weeks of using them though, I fell in love. These are some of my favorite shoes I\u2019ve run in. They\u2019re a bit heavy for track workouts or interval sessions but for just about everything else, these shoes are great. I\u2019ve really enjoyed them on longer efforts. In long runs they\u2019ve kept my legs fresh. When I pick up the pace to marathon effort, or maybe even a touch faster, I really feel like I\u2019m able to get some good energy return. But of course, slow, recovery, or just plain easy runs are the bread and butter of the 1080s.These are also a great option for casual wear - so much comfort.",

I wanted something to try as a test, typically I just run in whatever shoes I have, but I've found that my feet hurt and often form blisters.These met my price criteria and had great reviews at the price point, often taking the \"budget\" spot on top-lists on various sites. I'm not disappointed. My feet don't hurt and I haven't had anymore blisters despite increasing the distance in which I run vs. walking. That said, they aren't perfect for my wide feet in particular. I have found that they don't have enough in the arch department. This could be specific to my foot shape, but I've found that while it is wide enough to be comfortable, along the center it doesn't have  a wide enough base and my foot tends to rock inward as it lands. This leads to at least one of my feet becoming fatigued as that interior muscle along my arch tenses to make up for the lack of support.  If you have wide feet with little to no arch, this could be an issue for you as well. You'll want to stick to even terrain to combat this and pay attention to how your stride is landing, my neighborhood doesn't offer much perfectly flat road, unfortunately.That said, they are cheap, they are light, they keep my feet feeling fresh after a workout, instead of feeling sore all over. No blisters, no rubbing, no noticeable wear so far. A great holdover shoe for beginners until they can graduate to more expensive contenders in the wide-footed running space.",

        "review": "I\u2019m a recently retired, semi pro athlete, and I\u2019m very picky about my footwear. I have a straight lasted, narrow foot; very neutral gait; normal arch and no structural or biomechanics abnormalities other than boney ankles. I bought these NB Hierro trail shoes in the low cut version and they turned out to be my favorite trail shoes ever! And they have great durability - after a year and a half of regular use, they\u2019re still going strong (I alternate several pairs of shoes at a time to extend their mileage), but I\u2019m soon ready to retire them to be yardwork shoes. So I wanted to try these with a slightly higher ankle to keep the dirt & debris out better. I was a bit nervous because my ankles are so boney, so high tops often dig in. But these don\u2019t! \ud83d\udc4fThese are truly waterproof and have a gusseted tongue. They\u2019re very comfortable, responsive and cushioned - every bit as responsive and cushioned as the low cut version. They\u2019re light weight and very grippy, but you can still feel the road/trail for agility. And I really love the colors! It\u2019s a very cold gray, almost blueish grey. The lavender with dark pink accent colors are beautiful. They aren\u2019t too dark to wear in the summer, and they\u2019re attractive without being too bold so they don\u2019t clash with most outfits. These aren\u2019t nearly as hot as my winter hiking boots that are actual hiking boots and not just high top trail shoes. It\u2019s so nice to have both!There\u2019s only two negatives, which the low cut ones don\u2019t have. The toe shield on these is just leather, not hardened for extra protection like the low cut version. And you do have to be careful about how you lace these because the tongue is just barely wide enough, and something can dig in if you don\u2019t get it just right. I rethreaded one hole on the left shoe from under to over, and it\u2019s much better.I still wear Nike Vomero\u2019s on the road, but these are my favorites for the trails! \ud83c\udfc3\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83e\udd70",

        "review": "Update:Took these out on a hike at my local state park after a particularly wet week. There were lots of puddles, mud, and lots of places to slip.Tested water resistance when I sank into a muddy puddle. My foot got wet, but dried quickly. The traction was good when we had to cross large puddles on wobbly fallen branches.My feet stayed cool throughout the whole hike! I was impressed, even when it was pretty hot and humid out.Overall, these shoes are everything I needed them to be; cool, comfortable, cute, and supportive of my ankles and feet.\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014Original:I\u2019ve been on quite the hunt for a shoe that offered good ankle support, that\u2019s breathable for the summer, and something at least semi-cute. In the world of hiking, cute is not in the manufacturer\u2019s vocabulary\u2026 at least nothing that is reasonably affordable. I\u2019m pleased that these check all those boxes.I ordered these in a half size larger and in wide since I read several reviews about these being tight all over. The half size and width make these very comfortable and allow me to add thick socks for wetter and colder seasons! So plus!Bought these for an upcoming camping trip where there will be light hiking, but being pregnant, I need breathable shoes for the humid Texas heat. Haven\u2019t had a chance to test them out yet, but will update me them after I get a chance to put them to the test.It\u2019s worth noting that the rim of the ankles are stiff and does need to be broken in. Even with tall socks, they are rubbing.",

Tied them somewhat loosely to see if that helped, it did not. \u00a0Maybe they need to be broken in?? With this in mind I figured I would give them a fair shot and test them out. Put them on with boot socks and got on the treadmill.NOPE. Less than 5 minutes and I couldn\u2019t stand it. Felt like I was doing the Frankenstein/Herman Munster walk.

        "review": "First off, I'm a shoe nerd. I admit it. Growing up my Dad would buy us only \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude40 cheapest shoes he could find. They were so bad that we'd wear them out in a couple of months and I should be honest, I am not hard on my shoes, either (my older brother was a different story). Didn't make a difference. My Dad would rather buy us a pair of new shoes for $20 every couple months rather than spend $35 on ONE pair that would last at least a year (if not more). As a result, when I finally got a job and could buy my own, I had quite a collection. A habit I continue to this day.With that in mind, within the last year I've purchased 2 other pairs of New Balance trail running shoes which were (at that time) the most comfortable pairs of shoes I had ever purchased. Since then I bought a pair of Brooks Ghost Max which replaced those as the most comfortable pair of shoes I had ever owned.The Fresh Foam X have now replaced (by a slim margin) my Brooks for sheer comfort. I don't really run, but I DO an awful lot of hiking and walking. So strict comfort is pretty important to me. These shoes are simply brilliant in how comfortable they are. The previously mentioned New Balance Trail runners were, for a lack of a better term, had almost too much cushion. I know, how can a shoe have TOO much cushion? Well, those do...at least for me. For instance, I would never wear them for weight training, especially doing the dead lift. The cushion is SO pronounced that I'd be worried they could pull me off balance a little too easily. But then again, they aren't designed for weight lifting, so just keep that in mind.The Foam X shoes are a perfect balance between great cushion and sheer comfort. It must be hard for companies to achieve that balance without going too far but Kudo's to NB for pulling it off. The soles aren't as durable as the trail runners perhaps, but oh man are they a joy to wear. Again, since I don't run I cannot speak to how stable they'd be at doing any long/short distance running but man am I happy with mine.Overall \ud835\ude4f\ud835\ude43\ud835\ude40 most comfortable shoes I own (and I own a LOT). I am VERY satisfied with my purchase.",

They are so soft, yet responsive and my knees and back do not hurt after a 10k in them at race pace.The only problem I have with them is they are HOT.  On a hot summer day, your feet will sweat like crazy in them, so it is best to run when it's cool else you might end up with wet shoes haha.New Balance really hit it out of the park with these.  They are my favourite shoes next to Saucony Hurricanes (which were discontinued), and I feel that I may need to get more pairs in the future.Fit was true to size in length, but the wide (2E) is really wide and feels more like a 3E to myself and I am forced to use ankle lockdown to keep my feet from sloshing around during the first half of my run.",

There's a fairly wide toe box that gives my feet room to move around, but not too wide where I can lock in my feet comfortably. Stability is kind of an issue because the shoes are stacked high, but I'm just using them to walk at work. The arch support will hopefully keep my flat feet pain free throughout the day, time will tell. There's a lot of padding and weight with the shoes that are probably going to be a little warmer than most, and they're not very breathable. I can count on New Balance for their shoe quality and durability; they should last a long time. I was able to get these under 100 dollars in this color which is awesome! Navy blue is favorite color!

I bought these shoes after seeing a you tube video about relieving pressure on your forefoot for runners. I thought maybe it would help me. It really has. My wound is the best it has been and seems to finally be closing.The shoes fit true to size. I got wide ones and they are very comfortable in the toe box.  They are extremely light weight. When the package arrived I wondered if it actually had shoe inside.There is a slight learning curve if you are not used to the way these shoes redistribute your weight. At first it feels like you\u2019re falling backwards a bit. That subsides quickly. And finally, I think they look great though my family was quick to call them \u201cDad\u201d shoes. Well I am a Dad, so maybe it\u2019s not that bad. I certainly don\u2019t think they look like the older stereotypical new balance that men would wear with tube socks and shorts.

Shoes, even considerably less expensive ones usually last me a long time. The first pair of the New Balance started coming apart shortly after I started wearing them on light terrain. Amazon replaced them. The second pair started coming apart after I wore them about 5 or 6 times. This was from daily, gentle use, not even long walks. The soles have a honeycomb design. This design is flawed as segments of the sole start coming loose & create \"flaps\" that make it impossible to walk in them.

        "review": "I've run for almost 3 years in the defunct NB Evare, my first Fresh Foam shoe which offered very good cushioning. The 680v7 is similarly priced replacement. The 680 doesn't feel quite as cushiony and the heel is lower but I find it good for my 4 mile runs. Some complain about the narrow toe box but I find the toe box roomy compared to my other NB shoes.One BIG quibble - sizing. I bought my first NB shoes 10 years ago, size 10.5 D. Over the years, NB sizing has become smaller and smaller to the point where I'm ordering size 13. I take maybe size 10 in regular shoes. Extremely annoying.Size 13 is slightly loose but 12 is too tight. But it works well for me since there's room for the PROFOOT Orthotic Insoles for Plantar Fasciitis which compensate for the cushioning and heel height and also add arch support. Running feels very comfortable with the inserts.",

Because they are so affordable, I bought two pairs in order to rotate them throughout the week, but I liked them so much that I purchased one additional pair to use for work. My weekly mileage is nothing crazy--about 25-30 miles per week, and after putting over 100 miles on them they are still comfortable. Once I feel that I need to replace the ones I have, I will purchase the same shoes, or at least another NB shoe. I hate spending over $100 on a pair of running shoes, so I love the fact that this brand makes great running shoes that are affordable. I no longer buy any other brand of running shoes. They do run a bit small, for me anyway, so I have to buy a half-size bigger than I normally do with previous brands.",

        "review": "This is a great shoe!  Super comfortable daily shoes for me for the last few weeks, but there is a huge caveat: the toe boxes are low volume. The roof of the toe box is very close to the tops/knuckles of the toes. I tried my usual Saucony and NB  size, 10.5, in store and did not notice the claustrophobic toe box. I ordered 10.5 on Amazon and wore them in the house but never could feel comfortable and figured they would drive me nuts! I tried 10 wide (not extra wide) and that gave my digits more breathing room, solving my problem. I made a good choice going down a half size, as I believe 10.5 wide would have been too big.  The rest of the shoe does not seem to fit wide (admittedly I have not really worn wides before).Now that my toes can relax a bit I can appreciate the plush comfort of these babies. I like that the heel cups are not harsh or unforgiving, they are a little supple. I have been nursing both my Achilles tendons for a few weeks now\u2014breaking in Brooks Cascadia 16s on one hike nearly broke me!!I never notice the extended fins in back; I thought they might \u201ccatch\u201d going down carpeted stairs, but no issue.I am almost ready to get back in the mountains with these and really test them (and my heels) out. I will mos def buy more when I see a deal. Hierro V7 are my new favorites and I have tried numerous Adidas, Saucony, Merrill, North Face, and Scarpa trail runners and hikers the last few months. Robust, comfortable, and look rad.Edit:  I just did about an hour in the dry Boulder Flatirons at Chautauqua Park, and I love these shoes. The wides were barely big. I kept them fairly loose due to concerns with my Achilles and needing some extra give going uphill. Tightened them a bit just before descent, as usual, but didn\u2019t wanna fiddle with them again. Can easily, comfortably lock them down a bit more next time.Comfortable on trail, very soft, you do feel big rock points and ground features underfoot, but I did not mind. These Hierros do not feel tall to me\u2014great height/stack/drop that reminds me of my fave NB trail runners from 20 years ago. (I only wonder how they will hold up given how soft they are.)Edit: I now have three pairs of Hierros. Gotta say I would love some rock plate protection underneath as I have to be careful with foot placement on particularly pointy, sharp rocks (like 10% of the time on foothills trails). I occasionally trim down the hairy, wispy fibers that work their way out of the abrasion protection of the toe box. The shoes are all pretty easy to wipe down with a washcloth after a dusty hike.The Gore-Tex fit for me just like the regular V7.  I thought I\u2019d need to go up a half size like I often do for Gtx, but they were too big. Went back to 10 wide and they fit very well. You have to look at all the pix in the Amazon ad to see which are the Gtx (navy/black, crazy bright green!, and black/orange). I got the black with orange bottoms and have to say the orange is strangely close to pink\u2014not the \u201cclassic\u201d orange and black I expected. Not noticeable enough for me to exchange, though. They also have skinnier laces than the non-Gtx. The thicker laces work perfectly, but the skinny ones are a little finicky and knot up on me sometimes.  GREAT shoes.",

Overall sole cushioning is good without being mushy. But the best feature is the Vibram sole. It adds desirable overall stiffness (less toe lift), added width gives lateral support, and lessens feeling sharp objects beneath. The nicely lugged sole on smooth, interior surfaces feels secure, although produces some suction cup sounds at times. As other reviews have pointed out, the semi-hardened toe shields do produce unsightly \u201cfiber hairs\u201d over time.  I have trimmed them and they still come back. I do not know what impact this has on the shoe\u2019s function or use expectancy.",

        "review": "I have flat feet and suffer from Plantar fasciitis, which causes debilitating pain in my feet for days if I'm overworking my feet or wearing improperly fitted footwear. It's gotten so bad in the past I couldn't get out of bed without support like crutches or a knee scooter. It's heartbreaking to me to say the least, as I really enjoy being active and outdoors, but am afraid of the smallest slip or pushing it too hard for the fear I will be out of commission for days, so these days I am very very stringent on what footwear I buy/wear. I bought these after a small slip caused a PF flareup on the disc golf course, which is very hilly and full of uneven ground and rocky terrain.From early on I could see that these were a perfect fit for me, the wide size actually accommodated my foot and didn't bulge out like Nikes or Adidas shoes of the same size. The cushion is just enough without being \"marshmallow-y\" to where I've rolled my ankles in other shoes. the grip and weight of the shoes are great to avoid slips when walking up/down hills and rocky terrain. I've walked to/from my local disc golf course and played multiple rounds of disc golf back to back (~10 miles and 5 hours on my feet) in one day with not even soreness in my feet! The night/day difference after buying these shoes still astounds me.These are my absolute go-to shoes anytime I'm doing some outside active activity, I've even started doing short hikes/trails with the confidence that I won't have pain the next day and can just focus on the most important thing, enjoying the outdoors. I've been wearing these so much I'm seriously considering buying another pair or two before I wear these out prematurely! Those with flat feet or PF, don't think twice and pick up these shoes!",

I used to only run on roads for speed but do trails now that I\u2019m retired from competing. This is my second pair of NB Hierro trail shoes. My first pair were v7 Gore-Tex, and they were the best trail shoes I ever had! They\u2019re very comfortable, have enough cushioning &  protection, but I can still feel the ground which I like because they\u2019re more agile. They\u2019re light enough, and they look nice. And I love the toe protect! It has saved my toenails more than once. And both the cushioning and tread last incredibly long - longer than Nike and much longer than Brooks. I like these better than the Nike Pegasus trails because I felt my heels slip in the new Pegasus trails and because these have the toe protect and they last much longer, although I still prefer Nike Pegasus and Nike Vomero on the road.I like to have a second pair of both road and trail shoes to alternate each, and I only need one pair of each with Gore-Tex for when it\u2019s wet because without GTX they\u2019re more breathable and a tiny bit lighter. These v8 have a different tread than the v7 that is more grippy; otherwise they feel identical.The only thing I don\u2019t like about these is that they\u2019re wider than the last model, why do not to be a dealbreaker. I actually double check the box to make sure they didn\u2019t send me the wrong width. I probably won\u2019t buy them again because of this.These arrived in a super beat up New Balance box with torn paper. Fortunately, I don\u2019t really care about that. They were sealed in a plastic bag and then in another box that was in perfect condition for shipping. The shoes themselves are fine, but I can tell they\u2019ve been tried on because the laces were twisted. Again, I don\u2019t really care because I got them on sale and they\u2019re otherwise brand new with the tags still on, but I thought I\u2019d mention it for people who might care.",

I was reluctant to buy a shoe with a fairly thick sole, but the shoes were recommended by physical therapists as being one of the best for people whose knees are sensitive to concrete floors.  The shoe is well-padded inside - the arch support is perfect, the heel cup keeps narrow heels in place.  The toebox is wide and gives your toes plenty of room to move in.  Also, important to me is the mesh covering over the toe box.  I had surgery on my right foot and can never find comfortable shoes.  These shoes fit the bill.  Best of all, walking on concrete and suffering the rebounding effect of sore knees is gone.  The inner sole feels ergonomically designed for the bottom of the feet, and there is deep cushioning with a bit of spring action.  This is a perfect shoe for me.

My area plows their paths so I walked mostly on blacktop with a thin layer of snow/ice. These shoes have amazing grip on slippery surfaces and even in places where I walked through 4 inches of snow the grip was very good. The boots are fairly light weight and I love the fresh foam comfort. They fit well and are waterproof at least in snow. Perfect for my needs. I have a custom insole and it fit nicely inside.

I have goretex outer wear that is impervious to water so it is hard to understand why these were not the same. I did not even test them in rain, standing water, puddles, creeks or streams; only in 4-6 in long grass after a steady rain. Water only seeped in slightly at the toe but if more water, rain or foliage was present it would be worse. On a positive note the shoes are very comfortable. The laces require double tying - irritating. The eyelets in the shoe are not reinforced so the hole is deforming. Other lace \u201ccleats\u201d are a fabric that may be coming loose at the stitching. The top 2 cleats are metal & are fine. There is a \u201clip\u201d at the bottom rear heal that almost looks like mold forming excess that should have been trimmed. It may serve as a toe pry point to ease remove of shoe. However it collects dirt & sometimes catches on brush. Hope this aids your decision tree.",

My podiatrist recommend New Balance for my plantar fasciitis, but I'm beginning to think the brand is probably not as great as they used to be? The inconsistency in sizing is very disappointing. I'm returning the shoes I got because even after ordering a size bigger, I wore them around the kitchen while doing chores and they still seem to be too small.Edit 7/2024I decided to give these another chance and try to break them in. After about 2 weeks of wear, they finally feel normal. I would still suggest to size up at least half a size. Its still pretty snug. I wear them to work, but I wouldn't choose these shoes if I were to hike or walk long distances.",

During my runs, these shoes have provided me with more support and comfort than I had anticipated.The midsole's cushioning is excellent, delivering a responsive feel that deflects impact without being overly soft. My knees have occasionally been sore, but ever since I started wearing these shoes, I've noticed a noticeable change in how they feel after my runs.Even on slippery or uneven conditions, the outsole maintains outstanding traction. With every step, I feel secure and solid, which frees me from anxiety about slipping or sliding and lets me concentrate on my run.These sneakers' breathability is just another fantastic quality. Even during extended runs or in warm weather, the upper mesh material keeps my feet cool and dry. No more uncomfortable and hot feet!In terms of sizing, I discovered that these shoes fit true to size and offer a secure and supportive fit without being oppressive. The design is fashionable and I value the range of color choices that let me select a pair that goes with my running gear.",

I have an average arch, and this shoe has the right amount of arch for me.  The shoes are well made and have a nice tread.  I have worn these hiking and camping several times and wear them often for just normal wear.  The shoes are not advertised as waterproof but do seem to be water repellent.  I have not submerged them in water but have worn them in damp conditions, and my feet remained dry.Now for the negative, the insoles.  The insoles are textured. The original packaging indicated the insoles were massaging.  I found the texture mildly annoying from the beginning but livable.  After only 4 months, the insoles became very annoying.  I could feel the texture a lot.  The insoles seemed to become hard.  My feet began to hurt quite a lot.  I was disappointed that I might have to discontinue using the shoes.  I took the simple, flat, thin foam insoles out of another pair of shoes to try in them, and the pain and discomfort immediately stopped.  I'm going to buy a cheap pair of thin foam cushion insoles for this pair of shoes, so I can continue to use them.  The shoes look almost new and show very little wear on the tread. Another problem with the insoles was that they squeaked with every step.  That is no longer a problem with the original insoles removed.",

I can afford New Balance, I thought. I still spent $90 on these shoes titled Fresh Foam. I expected softness, foamy, cloud like comfort when i put my foot inside . I got none of that.  In fact, the shoe felt hard as a rock in the bottom. I guess the fresh foam refers to the bottom that you stand on. The phrase fresh reminds me of the 80's just like this scribble, paint design on the bottom of the shoe. I must've missed that in the picture. I found it ugly and immediately colored over that with a black market. So now I have spent almost $100 on shoes that I find to be rather uncomfortable and ugly. I've given it a couple weeks now and I can say these things: the toe protect is just a waterproof barrier but keeps toes from getting wet in puddles.  These do NOT qualify as slip resistant and will in fact send you skating . The main body of the shoe is net which I didn't notice when ordering. Not the warmest shoes for winter. I wouldn't recommend these to anyone and I wouldn't buy them again either.  I'm still on the hunt for some good shoes that make my feet happy. This foam isn't fresh enough for me.",

They looked nice when first opened and out of the box.The cons, the front part comes unsewed or unglued.My kid wears these shoes to go to school. He is very active, but has his own set of separate shoes for his other sports, baseball, soccer, football etc.The wear and tear of these shoes comes simple from everyday wear at school. I don't think a pair of shoes he's worn has lasted so little time.The front of the shoes are coming undone. I am now to find some shoes to replace these for another quarter. They looked nice enough, but they are not made for an active kid. These were \"running shoe\" definitely didn't hold on that. He does do running club.I would NOT recommend these shoes for an active kid, not even a runner. They are not made to last. They are not worth what you paid for.",

        "review": "I recently purchased the New Balance Men's Fresh Foam Roav V1 Running Shoes, and I couldn't be happier with my choice. These shoes have exceeded my expectations.First and foremost, the comfort level is off the charts. From the moment I put them on, it felt like I was walking on clouds. What's even more impressive is that there was absolutely no break-in period required. I wore them straight out of the box, and my feet were great from the get-go.One of the standout features for me is how incredibly lightweight they are. It feels like I'm hardly wearing shoes at all. This makes them perfect not only for running but also for everyday wear. Whether I'm hitting the pavement or just going about my daily activities, these shoes provide the support and comfort I need.Another huge plus is how breezy and cool they keep my feet, even during warm weather. The ventilation in these shoes is top-notch, and it really helps in preventing that uncomfortable sweaty feeling. My feet stay cool and fresh throughout the day.And let's not forget about style. These shoes are not only functional but also incredibly stylish. I've received compliments on their sleek design, and they easily pair with both athletic wear and casual outfits. They're versatile enough to suit any occasion.In conclusion, the New Balance Men's Fresh Foam Roav V1 Running Shoes are a winner in my book. They check all the boxes for comfort, style, and ease of wear. If you're looking for a pair of running shoes that deliver on every front, look no further. These shoes are a game-changer, and I highly recommend them to anyone in need of both performance and style in their footwear.",

Then I discovered this shoe (Garoe - another strange name) on amazon. It is truly spectacular. It does everything I'd want a shoe to do. For living in these casual days this shoe, in black with its cool blue details can almost serve as your everything-but-a-wedding shoe. Unless it was a casual wedding! I've run in them, ridden my bike, walked miles. I am most happy. Maybe the best shoe ever, for me. Do make sure you purchase the GORE TEX model.

It does the job and looks good free taking a beating.",

Whether I'm walking city streets or forest trails these are comfortable, light weight and support my ankles well. They don't get too hot and don't pick up aot of little stones or dirt. Great model. I looked at lots of different possibilities.Really happy I found these.",

Of course it is Gore-Tex, so you do not have to worry at all to get your feet wet. Both support and tractions are awesome. I did wear this all day several times and it is very comfortable after walking all day. Double wide width fits me nicely and it is a top notch shoe that I can recommend. Try it!",

The grip is solid, and the cushioning makes long hikes much more enjoyable. Whether you\u2019re on rocky trails, muddy paths, or shallow streams, these shoes hold up really well.The only downside is the tongue can be irritating if you\u2019re not wearing long socks. It tends to rub against the skin, which can get uncomfortable over time. But as long as you pair them with the right socks, they\u2019re a fantastic choice for outdoor adventures.Highly recommend for hikers looking for comfort, durability, and versatility!",

The boot arrived in one day, about 4 hours before a snow storm, so I got to try them out quickly on my 5 mile walk this morning. My area plows their paths so I walked mostly on blacktop with a thin layer of snow/ice. These shoes have amazing grip on slippery surfaces and even in places where I walked through 4 inches of snow the grip was very good. The boots are fairly light weight and I love the fresh foam comfort. They fit well and are waterproof at least in snow. Perfect for my needs. I have a custom insole and it fit nicely inside. The boot with the original inserts does not have much arch support which surprised me.",

        "review": "I would really like a breathable, waterproof hiking shoe but these are not. They are the most water RESISTANT shoes I have purchased on Amazon & certainly worth $50 but not $120. I have goretex outer wear that is impervious to water so it is hard to understand why these were not the same. I did not even test them in rain, standing water, puddles, creeks or streams; only in 4-6 in long grass after a steady rain. Water only seeped in slightly at the toe but if more water, rain or foliage was present it would be worse. On a positive note the shoes are very comfortable. The laces require double tying - irritating. The eyelets in the shoe are not reinforced so the hole is deforming. Other lace \u201ccleats\u201d are a fabric that may be coming loose at the stitching. The top 2 cleats are metal & are fine. There is a \u201clip\u201d at the bottom rear heal that almost looks like mold forming excess that should have been trimmed. It may serve as a toe pry point to ease remove of shoe. However it collects dirt & sometimes catches on brush. Hope this aids your decision tree.",

I wanted to start a shoe rotation, hearing that helps prevent injury, so I threw these shoes into my rotation. I also wanted to try to run without my orthotic to take advantage of the newer shoe models and technology that is built into them. I appreciated the comfort and cloud-like feel of these shoes. They have good support, and provide some extra return when pushing off. They are lightweight and comfortable. They provide good stability, although I also purchased the Mizuno Wave Horizon as my second shoe in the rotation, and that shoe is much more stable. The color is nice and the fit is good for me, although I have a more narrow foot. Overall, I am happy with the shoes and recommend them for those with moderate overpronation.",

These are harder- They aren\u2019t as soft as my New Balance Fuel Cell trainers or even my Pegasus but you can\u2019t expect all of that with these being gortex and trail shoes! They are still comfortable! I typically am a solid 8.5 and I did purchase a 9 and honestly could have sized up to a 9.5- My toe is almost right at the top. I put insoles in for added comfort but they pushed my toe so to the top they didn\u2019t work. I typically run 4-5 days a week 3 miles or more and these will definitely do the trick!

        "review": "I walk all year long and when it's wet/snowy I need something to keep my feet dry. So far I haven't had these out in a heavy rain, but they are waterproof. With that said, they don't seem to breathe very much, and my feet are a little warm/sweaty, but that can be mitigated with the right socks (moisture-wicking). As other reviewers stated, the toe box is a little tighter than you may be used to. My toe is sitting in the normal spot, but the vertical height inside the toe box is a little less than with a different style sneaker. This doesn't bother me, and after about 2 minutes, I don't even notice it. I feel like there was a short \"break in\" period needed, mainly for the area around the ankle. But that may just be the shape of my foot/ankle? After the first walk in them (~1 mile), they were fine, and I haven't had any issues since. I was originally thinking I'd need an insert to raise up my heel but I've decided I don't need that. I like the color too - not too flashy and not white (to show dirt). They provide ample support for walking, and I would buy them again. I have a high arch and high instep, and the middle of the shoe fits great, very comfortable (I've had issues with this in the past with certain New Balance styles). If you have a wider foot, this may not be comfortable for you though, given the more \"sandwiched\" toe box feel of the shoe.  I'm looking forward to some puddle jumping to really test them!",

After a visit to an orthopedic, he was diagnosed with flat feet, an as result, it was affecting his gait- hence the pigeon toed. He recommended New Balance sneakers, as well as gait plates to correct his walk. These were the first pair I ordered and I am truly happy. The design is really nice- sleek, modern and goes with any type of bottoms. I especially like that the actual inserts are removable and I can stick his plates in there without a problem. He says they are extremely comfortable, even with the plates and the plates themselves are hard plastic. I try to buy them in every color. These do run a little small, so maybe buy a half size up. However, if your kid needs to use inserts, try to buy just the right size to avoid discomfort. These sneakers hold up very well. He wears them everywhere and almost all the time. We have been hiking, to parks and long walks and they still look pretty good. They wash really well too! I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to find something close to this sneaker.",

I never write reviews but I do believe that these shoes, while much pricier than other brands, are so good for heavily active kids.  We did a trekking trip through Patagonia and he wore these for fifty miles in a few days (versus the Salomon boots that we had brought him).  His feet never hurt. He then continued to wear them for a few more months to school, basketball games, and yard time. So while I begrudgingly paid the $70 this week for a new paid, I reminded myself of all of the excessive use that these shoes endured. Definitely worth it.",

        "review": "I recently bought the Women's 510 Running Shoe from New Balance, and I couldn't be more pleased with my choice. During my runs, these shoes have provided me with more support and comfort than I had anticipated.The midsole's cushioning is excellent, delivering a responsive feel that deflects impact without being overly soft. My knees have occasionally been sore, but ever since I started wearing these shoes, I've noticed a noticeable change in how they feel after my runs.Even on slippery or uneven conditions, the outsole maintains outstanding traction. With every step, I feel secure and solid, which frees me from anxiety about slipping or sliding and lets me concentrate on my run.These sneakers' breathability is just another fantastic quality. Even during extended runs or in warm weather, the upper mesh material keeps my feet cool and dry. No more uncomfortable and hot feet!In terms of sizing, I discovered that these shoes fit true to size and offer a secure and supportive fit without being oppressive. The design is fashionable and I value the range of color choices that let me select a pair that goes with my running gear.",

For me they were too squishy and archy and it made my feet work harder to walk in, which was bothersome.  The good part is the insoles can be removed.  Once I removed the insoles they were much more comfortable for me.",

I did not end up returning them because I felt it would be a hassle.  So I ordered a second pair, this pair.Within a week, they are squeaking as well.

I have an average arch, and this shoe has the right amount of arch for me.  The shoes are well made and have a nice tread.  I have worn these hiking and camping several times and wear them often for just normal wear.  The shoes are not advertised as waterproof but do seem to be water repellent.  I have not submerged them in water but have worn them in damp conditions, and my feet remained dry.Now for the negative, the insoles.  The insoles are textured. The original packaging indicated the insoles were massaging.  I found the texture mildly annoying from the beginning but livable.  After only 4 months, the insoles became very annoying.  I could feel the texture a lot.  The insoles seemed to become hard.  My feet began to hurt quite a lot.  I was disappointed that I might have to discontinue using the shoes.  I took the simple, flat, thin foam insoles out of another pair of shoes to try in them, and the pain and discomfort immediately stopped.  I'm going to buy a cheap pair of thin foam cushion insoles for this pair of shoes, so I can continue to use them.  The shoes look almost new and show very little wear on the tread. Another problem with the insoles was that they squeaked with every step.  That is no longer a problem with the original insoles removed.",

        "review": "Just got these midcut trail runners and been walking around the house for awhile.Initially I hesitated to buy because I sometimes have issues with the mid-ankle height. They tend to bother my ankle bone... but not these New Balance. They are comfortable and do not rub or chafe the bone.My other issue was the chunky squared heel/sole. I thought it was going to be obtrusive.  After putting them on and checking them out I think they are rather complimentary and do not stick out at all.The materials used in these hikers are very good.  I sprayed water on the toe area and it beaded and ran right off, so they are waterproof as listed. Gore-tex rocks!! No one likes wet soggy feet while running and hiking around the country!!Arguably the best feature on this shoe is the locking lace hooks. The final top two lace hooks lock the lace in when you snap it in... great feature because you don't have to hold tension when tying the laces!!! My Merrell hiking boots do not have this feature and I am forever trying to hold them tension at the correct point while tying them. It's rather frustrating because it's hard to get them right... they either get tied too loose or too tight. Not so with these. Once you set the correct tension you simply lock the lace it and it gets held right there so you can tie the shoe with ease.I wear an 8.5 M... in every shoe I have ever bought,  so I bought an 8.5 M and in length they fit perfect. My foot is by no means wide but wearing mid-weight socks these kinda hug my foot and the toe box feels a bit restrictive. I much prefer a wider toe box to prevent toe issues and foot fatigue. So my only real complaint is that this may be an issue on long walks, runs or hikes. Also due to the materials used making these, I rather doubt they will stretch any.Overall, I am glad I decided to give these NB a try... they are more comfortable than my Salomon Speedcross 4s which for me are far too stiff in the soles and tire my feet out.I will keep this pair...",

The padding around the ankle helps stabilize my ankles while not being so thick and stiff as to be uncomfortable. I will say that some comments made mention of the shoe running slightly small. I think it's the width. I purchased my normal size 8 but got the wide version and it's perfect. I can wear thick socks if needed but don't feel like it's squeezing my toes.

From the first wear, they feel super comfortable thanks to the Dynasoft technology, which offers a soft, cushioned ride, perfect for both running and long walks. The lilac and white design is beautiful and modern, and goes great with athletic or casual wear.The traction sole is ideal for uneven terrain, and the suede finish gives them a sophisticated touch that isn't found in all athletic shoes. Plus, they feel lightweight, breathable, and very well made.I would definitely buy them again! If you're looking for comfort without sacrificing style, these shoes are an excellent choice.",

        "review": "- Sandals are cushiony, sinking in just a little to a solid-ish bed but without feeling too pillow soft or mushy. Have Fresh Foam shoes and can confirm the feel is similar.- Textured footbed provides grip for soles of feet so the sandal doesn't slip around. Also provides a slight relaxing massage feel.- Look is slightly bulky but overall pretty stylish, making more of a fashion statement that an IDGAF flip flop or velcro sandal.- Fit is a hit or miss. Width wise, this sandal fits both narrow and wide (2E) feet. However, the height of the upper (clearance from the footbed to the strap) does not correctly fit the proper foot size. Feet two (2) sizes smaller than the stated size cannot fully slide into it because of how restrictively low the upper is. The strap stretches somewhat, but after a few weeks of use it has not \"stretched out\" and always gives a too-tight-on-top-of-foot feel as if you were wearing a shoe one size too small and pulled the laces unreasonably tight.If you can dig the look and have not-tall feet (sole to top of foot), this recovery slipper will serve you well. For those of us with normal height feet, look elsewhere unless you like an extra snug feel - three stars ***",

It has held up well to daily use on the last 2 pairs, I really figured the string would break but didn\u2019t.  My son loves it and open and closes just to crank them down for fun so it really was tested a LOT so I give that a 10/10 on durability.I give the shoe 10/10 for durability overall as well!

As someone with wide feet, I\u2019ve struggled for years to find running shoes that truly fit. I normally wear a women\u2019s size 6 in length, but even in size 7.5 wide versions of many brands (including the highly recommended ASICS GT-2000 and Mizuno Inspire), my toes still felt cramped.Then I discovered that I could try wide-width boys\u2019 shoes instead \u2014 and I regret not trying this sooner! The toe box in the New Balance 860 boys\u2019 size 6 wide version gives me plenty of room for my toes to move comfortably, while still offering secure support around the entire foot. Breathability is excellent \u2014 even when walking outdoors in 90\u00b0F heat, I can feel airflow inside the shoe, which helps keep my feet cool and comfortable.The cushioning and support are great both for running and for long walks \u2014 my feet feel well-supported without any pressure points or stiffness.

It's not a dealbreaker, but definitely something to keep in mind if you're aiming for a deeper navy look.Sizing is also solid. I ordered a size 8, and while they run just slightly on the bigger side, they still fit well and don\u2019t cause any issues.

My normal size, and the regular wide is wide enough.Plus, they have a versatile & flattering silhouette that goes with any pants, from sweats to jeans, and a colorway selection to fit all tastes.

My son struggles with tying shoe laces, but still wants to wear \"cool\" shoes.New Balance always creates great colorways for their shoes and the BOA is no different--the design of the shoe is neat the way it crosses over to where you turn the dial to adjust and secure the fit.We've bought several pairs of these shoes over the years and find the quality is great. They live up to the way kids can be rough on shoes playing on the playground and he said they were really comfortable when he wore them during a recent Disney trip. He's put some miles on his current shoes and they are still going strong, but I'm going to order a pair to replace them for when the time comes.",

        "review": "I wanted to write a review after my child comments. Here is her opinion.I got these few month ago for my girl.She prefers White color and  Comfy BOA-Type Sneakers. She said incredibly impressed with both the design and functionality. These sneakers are a great blend of comfort, style, and practicality perfect for active during Gym class.#Pros:1. BOA Closure System\u2013 The standout feature of these sneakers is the BOA system, which makes putting them on and taking them off super easy. No more struggling with laces or velcro\u2014just a quick twist and the shoes are snug and secure. My child loves how fast they can get ready, and I appreciate how it makes it hassle-free to get the right fit every time.2. Comfortable and Supportive \u2013 The sneakers provide great cushioning and support, which is key for growing feet. The lightweight design doesn\u2019t weigh down my child, and the padded collar and tongue add an extra layer of comfort. After wearing them all day, there are no complaints about sore feet.3. Durable and Well-Made \u2013 New Balance is known for making durable shoes, and these are no exception. The material feels sturdy, and the rubber sole offers excellent traction, so my child can run, jump, and play without slipping or causing wear and tear on the shoes.4. Stylish Design \u2013 The all-white color with subtle New Balance branding gives these sneakers a clean, modern look. They pair easily with any outfit\u2014whether it\u2019s for sports, school, or casual wear. My child loves how trendy they look, and I love how versatile they are.5. Breathability \u2013 The upper material is breathable, helping to keep feet cool and dry during active play. I\u2019ve noticed that these sneakers don\u2019t trap moisture or cause any discomfort, which is a huge plus for all-day wear at school.#Cons:1. White Can Get Dirty Quickly \u2013 While the all-white design looks sleek, it does tend to get dirty quickly, especially in active kids. Regular cleaning is a must to keep them looking fresh.2. Price\u2013 Like most New Balance shoes, these sneakers are on the pricier side, but I do think the quality, comfort, and convenience justify the cost.===The New Balance Kids White Comfy BOA-Type Sneakers have been a fantastic choice for my girl. With the easy-to-use BOA system, comfortable fit, and durable construction, they\u2019ve become a go-to pair for everyday wear. If you\u2019re looking for a high-quality, stylish, and functional sneaker that will keep up with active kids, I highly recommend these!",

After examining them closely and comparing them with the first pair, I believe that the new ones are a knock-off.  The new shoes appear to be about a half size smaller, although the labels say they are the same size.  The roomy toe box in the original shoes ( which is an important feature for me) is narrower  and the contours of the shoes are almost straight up and down instead of curved to properly fit.  There are several other details that are \"off.\" I promptly arranged to return the shoes and described my concerns.  I would still like to have a second pair, but am hesitant to order them again.",

I picked them up recently and they\u2019ve quickly become a staple in my wardrobe.Style:These have that vintage court shoe vibe with a clean, minimalist look that works well with a lot of outfits. Whether you\u2019re into sporty streetwear or just want a low-key sneaker with subtle retro flair, the 480 V1 delivers. The \u201cN\u201d branding is bold without being flashy, and the overall silhouette is timeless.Comfort:For a sneaker based on a basketball silhouette, the comfort is impressive. The Ortholite insole gives you good support, and the padding around the ankle adds extra comfort. They\u2019re great for all-day wear\u2014walking around, running errands, or casual hangouts.Fit:They fit true to size for me. The toe box isn\u2019t overly narrow, which is nice if you like a bit of room, and the laces allow for a secure fit. The leather upper is a bit stiff out of the box, but it softens up nicely with wear.Quality:The materials feel solid\u2014especially for the price point. The leather upper feels durable, and the sole has good grip and traction. I\u2019ve worn mine in a few different conditions, and they\u2019ve held up really well.Final Verdict:If you\u2019re looking for an everyday sneaker with heritage appeal, solid comfort, and clean styling, the New Balance 480 V1 is a great option. It\u2019s easy to wear, well-made, and offers that classic New Balance feel without the bulk of some of their other models.\u2e3b",

Nice wide grippy sole for stability with Minimus zero drop profile. Although, I'll admit that adding a lightweight padded insole would make these supreme. I love NB Minimus shoes and was disappointed when NB got rid of their Minimus running line...My only complaints are the neoprene tongue because it slides a bit and the size issue which hints at lower production QA standards for New Balance. Regardless, it's a great lightweight zero drop shoe, especially if you can get them on sale. Easily 4 stars, 5 if my regular size fit out of the box.Pro-Tip: run the laces over themselves at the last loops for DIY lace lock. See pic.",

When I was running ultra marathons, the Minimus Road and Minimus Trail were my go to shoes.  Those were also size 11 Wide and the fit and comfort were also amazing.

Then I bought more expensive shoes by \"Florsheim\" but the slip resistant aspect of the shoe was poor and not comfortable after a long days work. However, these New Balance are exactly what I was searching for!!! They're really comfortable, as well as slip resistant. Inky thing is the size issue. I ordered my normal size, a size 10 W,  and the fit was a little bit too snug. I wore them for the day, and they eventually loosened up a bit. Overall, if I had to buy this shoe again, I would!!!",

The pair of NB806 I most recently purchased that was specified to be the same size as all the pairs previous ordered was not wide enough nor long enough. I returned the first pair and ordered a wider (4E) pair as a replacement.  These were also very tight across the width of the shoe and very uncomfortable. Although I continued to try to wear them past the return deadline thinking they would loosen up, they have been very uncomfortable and I will not purchase Newbalance shoes like this in the future.

She is an older working woman, (I am a young working woman), and she gave me a pair of these that she had worn through and let me tell you man, those were genuinely the most comfortable pair of shoes I\u2019ve ever worn. My feet are wide and the shoes were not, so due to them being so comfortable, I was then forced to buy a new pair and they are just wonderful. I genuinely couldn\u2019t recommend these enough. They offer great arch and ankle support, they\u2019re ridiculously comfortable, and they\u2019re really cute chunky white dad shoes. My one note is that they run a little narrow, so if you have a wider foot you may want to buy a wide pair in your size rather than just going up a size. Seriously tho,  I never write reviews, but these shoes are so good I had to. Highly recommend them especially for older people, (but I also love them as a 26 yr old). The shoe size I purchase was an 8 1/2 wide and they fit perfectly. These shoes are so good that when they eventually are ran through, I\u2019m planning on just buying another identical pair. I\u2019m almost certain these are the only pair of tennis shoes I\u2019m going to wear for years to come.",

I know what it takes to push the limits and now that I am playing in a very competitive adult baseball league, I know that: comfort, light weight and stability are valued benefits from a training shoe.I play Adult BB as a catcher and these trainers have added protection at the front of the toe without sacrificing mobility or comfort. The light weight foam allow me to wear these shoes just about everywhere, and the grip nubs are perfectly sized for everyday wear. The grip/traction is amazing on every surface, not just turf! Grass, dirt, concrete, slab cement, aluminum, etc\u2026 have all been tested and I have excellent traction.I removed the stock laces and replaced them with bungee laces (this allows more even top-foot pressure across the foot - something I learned from years as a marathoner and triathlete).Highly recommend these trainers for anyone serious about their training or that just appreciate a comfortable and capable athletic shoe.I usually purchase size 10 for all of my shoes, and these are no different. Just order your normal size and your will be good to go.I have normal width feet but I\u2019m more flat footed than most people I know. The toe box fits comfortably secure and does not move around, while the heel are stays put like it should.

I\u2019m a truck driver so I do set and drive a lot, but I have to unload my 48 foot truck by myself and walk back and forth climbing, Twist pool squat. Over all there pretty darn Comfortable. But they are heavy. Close to the wight of boots. And they don\u2019t breath very well I thing my feet sweat a lot I might wind up with Athletes foot. If I don\u2019t take them off on the long drives. Only time will tell if they hold up I\u2019m really hard on shoes. I will give an update at 6 months. And when I finally destroy the shoe.Iv been wearing the shoes 6 months now there holding up and especially cleaned. Because there waterproof they keep my feet dry from outside water and snow they work great for grip on snow ice water oil vinegar, milk, whatever spilled in the truck. They do make my feet sweet and there are starting to smell like a nasty gym locker room. I have to leave them in another room or in a bag. The backs by the Hill are starting to wear holes from slipping my foot in and out. And the material between the steel toe and my toes is wearing thin and feeling a bit uncomfortable. My toenails have scrapes in them aren\u2019t the best shoes for Dolly Work. But over all I hate boots so I still like them. And would definitely buy again.",

        "review": "These are often called \"grandpa\" shoes because they look a little clunky but they are still the best shoes I have found for exercise classes and basketball in that they are extremely stable through the last and I have not had an ankle turn since I started wearing them yeas ago. The bottoms of my feet are sensitive with minor neuropathy and these shoes fit wonderfully and wrap the foot well. The pivot point is great for people who take a cardio, Jazzercise, Shine, or equivalent class in that it facilitates turns, spins, and rapid direction changes.I do have to get a full size larger in Nike shoes (in all Nike clothes for that matter). After a couple of months of heavy use these Air shoes will start to squeak, often quite loudly, well before they wear out. I simply remove the lining  from the shoes and put baby or other talcum powder into the tiny holes under the lining and work it into the holes. This has served me well for years to stop the squeak and it has the additional benefit of freshening up my shoes.I have tried numerous shoe brands over the years and the only shoe that came close to the comfort and stability of this shoe is the Strutter from Adidas, which is no longer made to my knowledge and didn't last as long anyway.One thing Nike could do better is to more firmlyvsecure the sole to the body of the shoe. The glue used by Nike to secure the rubber part of the sole is the first part of the shoe to fail, especially if these shoes get wet regularly from rain or wet grass or even puddles when going to and from your car and the gym classes. I can normally get 6 to 8 months out of the shoes and I have at least 8 one hour classes of various intensity a week (and I do my best to keep the bottoms dry!).For those who wear orthotics, these shoes take them well whether they are heel focused, toe focused, or cover the whole foot. I now wear Goodfeet orthotics and they are quite comfortable in this shoe.",

In spite of fitting the same inside, the actual shoe seems about an inch longer than my other Nike size 11s. It\u2019s not a deal breaker and it doesn\u2019t impact the comfort, it might even make them more comfortable, but they look a bit large on my foot.

I definitely recommend these for hotter weather since they are light and airy especially if you often get athletes foot from being on your feet all day in shoes.

        "review": "Honestly one of the best shoes on the market for wide foot people, if your looking to snag a simple set of running sneakers, in my opinion. Here's some in-depth info along with  pro's and con's:TLDR: Great quality shoes for the price, and easy to clean. Recommend to beginner and intermediate runners/hikers, experts may be willing to pay more money for increase of quality.PROs:- Perfect Fit. I usually wear 9.0 wide (USA), so that is what I ordered and it fit perfectly.- Comfort and Ease. I like how comfortable they are and they are easy to slip on and off (if you wish) by the use of the heel pull tab. The tab also prevents the heel from getting bunched in or broken when putting on the shoes, which was a frequent problem with some other brands I have owned in the past.- Easy to Clean, Quality Mesh. I have seen some reviews saying these shoes wear out easily or the mesh is easier to damage. YMMV but I didn't seem to have this issue and I've had these shoes for about a year. IMO I find the mesh to be much more durable than the cloth mesh most sports shoes have these days and much easier to clean, which is essential for anyone like myself, who often hikes or runs in forestry/mud.- Above Average Quality. As for the year timeframe, the 1st set was about 8 months of extreme use, then I purchased a 2nd pair which I've had for about 3 months now. This may seem like a short timeframe to some but for me, I usually have to change shoes every 6 months or less if they are lower quality because they get a lot of mileage and use. I still have the 1st set which I use as \"lawn mowing shoes\", as they are still usable but the tread does not get much grip/traction anymore for running. I liked them enough to buy that 2nd pair instead of some other brand/model.- Decent Arch Support and Sole Tread. You will find other shoes with the same or better, but I didn't see many that were this cheap in price.- Part of Amazon's \"Try Before You Buy\". Free try-ons. You can take up to 6 days to decide whether to keep/return if you wish, and only be charged if not returned by the 7th day. Day 1 is the day they are delivered.- Uniform in Color. The shoe currently comes in all-black or all-white, including the logo. YMMV but this is a pro for me due to work restrictions requiring all-black shoes, so I can also wear them leisurely at work if I choose (I'm a mechanic). Great for anyone with the same issue, or military, etc.CONs:- Not the most expert/elite quality shoe out there, but will definitely check most people's boxes for average needs, imo.- Cost is higher than one might desire for just simple leisure shoes. But as an avid runner, the price is about average. However, they are usually on sale. My 1st set was around 40% off which dropped it from $70-something to $43, which was worth it for me. 2nd set was about 20% off. Winter holiday seems to be the best time for sales price.- Tread pattern is smooth and circular, instead of rigid and square/triangle, in case that matters to you (in regards to rock climbing etc)Overall I was surprisingly satisfied with this shoe model personally, but your mileage may vary.",

I ordered multiple Brooks to try on and none was a truly good fit.I'm going to be doing a lot of walking, so I may purchase an additional insert but for everyday wear they are more than adequate without an insert.I'm happy to find a new brand, that has a dependable sizing system.Shoe quality:The quality appears to be goodArch support:arch support is goodMaterial thickness:SubstantialColor:blackSlip resistance:hopefully good I haven't been able to test drive in wet surfaces yetLightweight:yes, lightweight",

Granted, I'm not on my feel all day, but I probably walk more than most office workers.Cons: Nothing significant.Other thoughts:These aren't \"sneakers\" in the way that they make you silent.  The bottom of the shoes are harder than my Nikes, and make a little bit of sound when you walk on a hard floor.  Not an issue unless you're an aspiring ninja.The bottom part of the shoe (the white piece) is larger than your feet.  This gives more stability, but makes your feet look a bit bigger than they are compared with my Nikes.The top of the shoes are breathable.  They are mesh rather than a simple fabric like my Nikes.  As a result, they don't stretch as much.  Just a personal preference which one you like more.Finally - this came in its original shoe box and the box was a bit squashed.

        "review": "Very nice shoe. Well built & appears durable. I especially loved the soft ankle.With high arch/high instep and wide forefoot, these shoes were not a good fit for me. Despite being men's running shoes, they felt like a women's B width. There is zero give the way they are stitched making them super tight across the forefoot at the base where lacing begins, and I mean cutting off circulation tight!It's clear to me that these shoes are made for heelstrikers with narrow feet:1) Exceptional shock absorbing heel cushioning that gives rather than squishes;2) Very little forefoot cushioning but provides good toe-off springboard action.What I found peculiar is that Nike did away with the 3rd gas tube running front to back with this model. No middle tube made my feet feel like they were being forced down midfoot\u2014something that has actually resulted in stress fractures in the past\u2014because I AM a supinator (underpronation, which means my natural gait strikes along the outside of my feet).They felt \"corrective\" so I would NOT recommend these to supinators, those with high arches and/or high instep, and definitely not to wide footers or wide forefooters, or forefoot strikers. Shin splints (along with other painful maladies) WILL occur\u2014guaranteed!About me:  I was an avid fitness enthusiast years before I ever set foot in a commercial gym\u2014and that was 35 years ago. Since then, I went on to become a personal trainer, taught aerobics for 20+ years, and have worked in numerous gyms\u2014two of which I managed for some time.And for most of that time, I've been a Nike snob. However, their latest \"improvements\" on new models and elimination of older ones convey a simple message:  It's time to pack up my toys and move on. My groundpounders deserve compatible playmates.4 stars because I believe this to be a Nike typical, high-quality shoe. No 5th star because there is no mention or caution on the incredibly narrow width in a men's shoe, or the zero give with this new stitching, nor is there any information on the type of runner this shoe would\u2014or would not benefit.",

The Invisible Fit membrane keeps water out without giving that plastic-bag feel\u2014my socks stay dry, and the shoe flexes like a regular trainer instead of a clunky winter boot.Underfoot, Nike\u2019s new ReactX midsole brings road-shoe energy to mud, roots, and crushed-shell paths. I finish runs feeling bouncier than I have any right to on swampy routes. The outsole lugs and sticky rubber grab wet boardwalks and slick limestone with zero drama, so I\u2019m not tip-toeing every time a puddle shows up.Little design touches seal the deal: an extended ankle collar that blocks sand and pine needles, a 3-D toe cap that shrugs off rocks, and a black/grey colorway that looks totally normal at the brewery post-run. The only trade-offs are the premium price\u2014about $180\u2014and slightly warmer feet on steamy days. Thin socks solve the latter; the waterproof peace of mind justifies the former.Bottom line: If you want one shoe that handles ankle-deep puddles yet still feels lively on dry pavement, the Pegasus Trail 5 GTX delivers.

I went back to the same store a couple of years later to buy them again but they did not carry the same model.  I was very happy to find them on Amazon in many more beautiful colors than the two colors my initial pair were available in.  I had bought my first pair for $60 and feel that spending $100+ is rather expensive but it is also difficult to find running shoes that feel so good and I loved the bright color so I bought 3 more pairs to hopefully keep me in running shoes for the next several years.  My first pair has held up very well for me and have been washed several times so I feel good about the overall quality of the shoes.I have low arches and have had double bunion surgery many years ago so I usually exchange the insoles that come in shoes for insoles with an arch.  I did not need to do this for about three years with my first pair but lately began having some toe pain so I simply added added a gel arch under the regular insole and that easily solved the problem.I generally wear a 5 or 5.5 but a 6 fits me perfectly.  I also have narrow heels and these shoes gently hug my feel all around, giving a solid feeling of stability and lightness.",

Wildlife creatures are running for their lives when I attempt to walk my local natural trail. Hunters are angry that I scared off the 8 point buck from a mile away that they've been staying all season. I seriously can't hide at work. They know exactly where I am and when I'm walking down the halls. I'm 5' 10'', 185. It's not like I'm hurting the shoes but they are screaming for help with every step! I know, I know. It's just a inexpensive pair of shoes that some hard working child in Indonesia put blood and sweat into producing.  I really do appreciate every tear that they shed to glue them together, but they missed a spot. The most important spot. The spot that keep the shoe from squeaking. So to everyone that's has to hear me walk in them in the local Walmart and Target, I'm sorry! I wearing them for your enjoyment (with earbuds in my ears) so you can have a laugh for the day. One little star. You're welcome...",

As I flew ybackward, I recall looking up at the sky, and to my surprise, I saw one of my brand new shoes flying by.  Next thing I knew I was lying there on the cold, hard sidewalk in such shock I layed there for what felt like forever. I slowly began to rise to my feet. I started to check myself for any injuries when suddenly I got a whiff of a nostril-burning foul smell. I reached my hand around to my back only to bring it right back abruptly.  I let out a loud scream followed by a gagging reaction to the dog poop that was now on my hand.  I ran to the grass and dropped to my knees I frantically began wiping my hand on the grass. As a tear ran down my face I remembered thinking can this day get any worse? Well, guess what it did! Behind me was a loud bark that scared me so much I jumped forward. I was now lying on the ground once more. As I got to my knees, I stood up quickly, eager to see the culprit that I believed to be the doggy doo doo bandit, but as I turned around to confront this demon, I promptly began to plead because in this dogs mouth was my other shoe I slowly began to approach this dog as I got close enough I made a daring move I tried to jump on the dog. I was unsuccessful with dog poop on my back, and with only one shoe on, I began to walk home sad and smelly.  Anyway I hope this helps your decision to buy these shoes or not",

White is a great shoe color and most running shoes look ugly in my opinion.I was concerned coming into this with how dirty it would look due to dirt, but it's actually very manageable. Simply throw it in the washing machine with some Oxyclean, air dry, and it looks nearly brand new. If excessively soiled, soak in Oxyclean overnight and then wash.The fit is true to size but slightly snug as you break it in. The entire front of the shoe is like a soft mesh so it's very comfortable, but that also means if you kick anything it'll hurt, trust me. The cushion is pretty good- an upgrade over non running shoes but not excessive like Hoka's. I can walk for about one and a half hours before my feet actually start hurting.Overall, would recommend. Definitely is kinda pricey but it's hard to find good looking running shoes so it's an L I was willing to take.",

        "review": "I am thoroughly amazed and grateful these are just what I needed. My last pair of NB were walking shoes and was last bought 5 or 6 years ago. I do tons of walking but don't drag my feet so the soles don't wear fast and I don't let them get wet, but it was time to get a new pair. These new ones are perfect in every way, absolute comfort, roominess, but snug enough fit with a good amount of comfort padding inside, and they have the exact size dimensions of the last size 15's I had from 5 to 6 years ago, maybe a slight tad wider for even better comfort. I love that they don't pronate (tilt to one side from overly spongy soles) and are even more stable for the ankle than the last ones. They also don't have excessive heel height which is a huge problem for me in this trend of making heels too high since i have ankle issues and had to have surgery on my feet at age 4, so I was told my my orthopedic doctor my feet could not handle excess sloping, i.e., higher heels. In this regard, it reminds me of barefoot shoes with a flatter more even profile, but still with good arch support and still perfect shock absorbing comfort (not excessive since I can't handle excess arches). Glad I came across the perfect fit shoe for me, though there is one thing I hope will last and that is four of the shoelace eyelets in the middle were done differently for stylistic reasons: they are put through some type of fabric loop instead of the leather that the other holes are made to go through. If those loops have stitching that fails at some point then one would have to resort to drilling a hole into the leather where it normally would go through because they had to do this \"cool\" looking style feature. Who knows, maybe it will last okay. The price is great too, and hope they don't read this and raise it!",

I have walked nearly 2 million steps since then in these shoes and they have great durability. I rotate them with another pair that I bought on Oct. 27, 2024, which has helped reduce the wear and tear. I removed the insoles and replaced them with PowerStep ProTech Control Orthotic Insoles and my feet feel great. The weight feels great on my feet and I don't have any foot fatigue after walking 10,000-20,000 steps in them. The 12W are now too wide for my feet but I still highly recommend this shoe. They are easy to clean and still look good on the outside. On the inside, I've worn the heel area out.I purchased the White/Team Royal version in size 12. I loved these as they fit better as I've been losing weight. The downside, the inside cushioning around the heel and ankle is gone. Worn out. I guess roughly 2,000,000 steps is a bit too much for this pair. Nonetheless, I do recommend these 608s.",

What stood out the most is how easy they were to break in\u2014practically no adjustment period was needed. Within the first couple of sessions, they already felt like a natural extension of my training routine.The breathability is another strong point; the mesh upper keeps my feet cool even during long, high-intensity workouts. The stability in the heel gives confidence under heavier lifts, while the forefoot remains flexible enough for sprints, jumps, and dynamic movements. It\u2019s a rare balance of support and comfort that makes the Metcon 6 Free versatile for both strength and functional training.Overall, this shoe delivers on all fronts: comfort, stability, and ease of use.

Aside from comfort, being lightweight, and accommodating wider feet (unlike version 5 of the same sneaker), what really stands out about these is their versatility. I've never had a workout sneaker (metcon, running sneaker, powerlifting shoe) that has provided ample stability to perform barbell squats while also being comfortable, flexible, and lightweight enough to do an hour of cardio in. I wish that they lasted me slightly longer than 5 months, but considering what I put them through, these are great value for the money.

Before purchasing these shoes for my Gold'sFit workout class, I used running shoes, but running shoes did not provide enough lateral support and stability during lifts and doing side to side movement. The Nike Metcon 6 feel much more stabile and confidently perform through a variety of activities. When I started looking at other people's shoes in the gym, I was surprised how many also also chose the Nike Metcon.",

I\u2019ve shared photos of what they looked like, immediately after opening the package from Amazon- just not happy about the fact that I thought I was buying BRAND NEW shoes, which these were obviously not! Since he needed the shoes now, I decided to not return them, but just wanted to leave this review to let others know what I experienced. Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe\u2026is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I\u2019ve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width\u2026super convenient and very comfortable! The bottoms feel like they\u2019d be slippery, but my husband says they\u2019re really not. The insoles are not as soft as his other pair (different style), but he says they feel like they\u2019ll be more durable!So I\u2019d definitely leave a 5 star review for the shoes themselves, but 3-star was given simply because they were not new, as described.",

        "review": "This is my 3rd pair of this model (Interact Run). This is my 2nd pair of the white/day-glo green logo model. The shoe just looks great. I get a lot of compliments on its looks.Fit: I wear a 9.5 Wide, typical shoe size. However, on my work out shoes I usually go up to a size 10. I need the extra toe box width. This size 10 feels a little tight to begin with, but it does stretch out pretty quickly. I did order a 10.5 on one pair and it opened up the toe box, but is a little loose.Durability: The tread is not very deep, so I find that I am wearing the grooves out in my major contact areas pretty quickly. I am getting about 90 days of everyday workout use before the certain areas are slick. The shoe is still very serviceable, so it gets relegated to a walking or casual shoe.Value: I could sometimes get this shoe for under $60. That for me is a great value. Similar shoes go for around $120 in my experience.I would highly recommend for an indoor gym / cross training shoe",

I was a croc wearing person for years but they wore out quickly and being in healthcare they were not the best. I kept my eye on these but couldn't find much for reviews. I worried I was too heavy for the air pads, and some said they were weird to walk on. I took a chance, and now I am a forever fan! They felt Like walking on crocs, but they make me walk straighter, not on the outside edges anymore. My feet don't hurt after walking all day, and they are quick grippy. The only downfall of these shoes are that they are squeaky, like my coworkers know it's me coming down the hall. I like the color, the material is soft and not like a regular rigid sneaker, which is great for those with hot feet, and I get compliments all the time! I got a half size bigger for my wide feet.",

But after a few workouts at the gym and a few miles walking on pavement, they've broken in nicely and are much more comfortable.  They're fast becoming one of my favorite pairs of shoes.I wear a size 13 mens, and the shoe is spot on for fit.  I also have a higher instep, and these shoes fit quite well.

        "review": "I started using these shoes on June 11, 2019.  At the time of this writing, that's almost 6 weeks. I'd suggest when you are reading these reviews you keep in mind how long the reviewer has been trying out the shoes; it can take several weeks to fully get used to a new shoe and reviewers who give hasty reviews (either good or bad) are not giving you the real picture.____________________In a nutshell, I got these shoes so I didn't have to spend a bunch of money on running shoes AND gym shoes. Nor clutter up my closet with too many pairs of shoes.  After using them for over a month, I am surprisingly satisfied.First off....I'm 6 foot and 175 lbs. My shoe size varies between 10.5 and 11 USA. My foot is slightly wide, with good arches.  I got these shoes in a size 11 and they fit great.  But not at first.....for the first 4-5 wearings they felt tight around the middle of my foot. At first I was disappointed and felt like they were not going to be a good fit. But after about a week of wearing them, they broke in just fine, and the fit now is great. I attribute the tight feeling to the plastic side braces that the shoestrings lace through: if you lace them overly tight, that will contribute to the uncomfortable feeling.My experience:  I have been running at least 3X a week for over 40 years. I've weightlifted and/or cross trained on a regular basis for over 30 years. I have been a personal trainer in the past (certified by ACE). I've run one of the toughest marathons in the world (Big Sur International Marathon), although I consider myself an average runner. I've used everything from cheap $40.00 Big 5 shoes for running to $130.00 Brooks. I've never bought a pair of shoes specifically for weight training or cross-fit workouts; I've always used running shoes for that.Here's how I wear them:- running 1-2 times a week. My average run is around 2.5 miles, but I've run up to 6 miles in them and they performed well. I would not recommend wearing these for regular runs longer than 3 miles because that's not what they are built for. I run mostly on pavement in California (moderate weather), although I just did a 6 mile run on trails in preparation for a 10K race later this month.  I feel like that was pushing the shoe to its limit, but it did fine.- stationary biking.- weight workouts. I do squats, standing barbell curls and overhead presses and these shoes are stable and don't shift. Of course you need to adjust the tightness of the laces depending on what you're doing and that's the cool thing about these - you can loosen them up a bit for non-critical exercises like stationary biking or tighten them up for running or squats.- kettle bell swings: again, they are stable and flexible.- burpees: this particular exercise really tests the stability, flexibility and shock-absorption of the shoe. If you've never done a burpee, I suggest Googling it to see what the movements are. In this exercise the shoe is subjected to squats, kick-outs where I land on the toes as I do a push-up, then they flex as I bring my feet back under me and jump up into the air, forcing them to not only be stable in launching me up but in absorbing my return to earth.I work out in these shoes 6 days a week.  The photo shows them as of today, nearly 6 weeks into daily use.  I typically run a couple days a week, do burpees 2x a week, weight lift 2-3 times a week, kettle bell swing 2x a week and do moderate cardio such as stationary bike 1-2 times a week.I didn't buy these to replace running shoes; I got them to use as short-distance runners and gym shoes. You shouldn't get these if you are doing multiple runs of more than 3 miles in a week - they aren't going to give the performance and protection you need for serious running. But for gym work, cross fit training and shorter runs, they are great and can replace expensive running shoes.You should note that the plastic shoe lace-ups/brackets on the side of the shoe have 3 positions. The position closest to your toes is the least secure/loosest fitting style. Each hole you lace going back towards your heel tightens the shoe's grip on your foot.  I use the middle lace hole for running and burpees and the stability is fine.  I lace it all the way to the back hole for squats to make sure the shoe doesn't slip.I've noted some reviewers say the \"sock\" collar around the ankle opening is loose.  I can say yes, it doesn't fit flush to your ankle when laced up, but that doesn't mean it slips! My foot is stable even if the sock appears to be loose-fitting. It isn't overly warm or hot, either (I was worried about that when I first got them).Again, if you're a serious runner I'd invest in good running shoes and use these for the gym. But if you're a casual runner of shorter distances and fit in weight training and/or cross-fit training, these shoes do a great job.I'll close by saying that in the last 20 years or so I've gotten wiser and have spent more money on running shoes, and with these shoes I've gotten my first shoe specially designed for cross-training also. I am happy with the performance of the shoes so far. I've never had a serious running injury, partially out of luck but largely because as my joints have gotten older I've used better shoes.  Good luck and good health to you!",

I am a lifelong NIKE customer and this quality is on point with the Nike brand. Very good heel cushion as I have some slight heel pain to deal with. Four stars for the design of the shoe laces. I have thin ankles and the shoe slips unless you thread the shoelaces through the second loophole at the top of the shoe lace row. I realize it is a 'me' problem and not a shoe problem - but thought it would be helpful to share how I solved this problem to make the shoe work for me. Also, the shoe is lightweight and cool - the bottoms are light colored. If you live in a very hot climate (like VEGAS) the asphalt is very very hot. If you wear a dark sole shoe it absorbs the heat and makes your feet so very hot. I would recommend wearing a thinner sock with this shoe if you are a runner/walker. It seems to enhance the comfort.

I used to be be five foot 7.5 inches but am now five foot 6.5 inches but my feet have grown from 8.5 to a size 9 women's. I bought an awesome pair from Nike's last year but the 9s were a little tight. I can't find good women's Nike Shox on amazon so I took a chance at the men's. There was only one I liked with those cool designs and colors. I've bought this style before too. They last a long time. I used to take a size 7, so I guessed maybe 8.5. They fit perfectly and are soooo comfortable and the company sent them in a nice box all packed up with paper inside the shoes. So pretty too! Love them!",

        "review": "I bought this for cross training/HIIT and weight lifting to replace my old Nike. I paid 48 dollars for the grey color, which is perfect for my needs. This shoe is super light (I don't lile bulky shoes) and can feel like barefoot at times. It performs really well on body combat classes for high kicks and jumps, it does well on weight training, and it is almost good for HIIT. My only negative for it is that it has very limited lateral support for HIIT training, and that it feels a bit too wide/roomy for my narrow-ish feet (I'm a 7, 117lbs/5'5\" and bought a 7). Also it slides backwards slightly for lunges, but not for squats. It also slides backwords for planks, so I need to place my feet on the mat to stay put.I did some light treadmill running in these and they worked for the lower intensity/short runs as well.Overall, I reccomend this shoe. If it's for walking / kicking around, these are super light and comfy and cute. If it's for cross training, these offer a very lightweight, responsive shoe (as opposed to the bulky ones with added whistles and bells) and it may surprise you that you will pick them every time for a quick gym workout.",

        "review": "\u200bRun, Don't Walk, Away from These \"Nikes\"\u200bIf you're in the market for a new pair of running shoes, I have a recommendation for you: run as fast as you can in the opposite direction from these. I don't know who made these, but I'm pretty sure their product development meeting went something like this: \"Okay, we need a running shoe that looks like a Nike, but is it a Nike? Absolutely not. Will it support your foot? No. Can you run in it? You can try. Should you try? Probably not.\"\u200bThe lack of support is truly a work of art, a masterpiece of structural failure. It feels less like I'm wearing a running shoe and more like I'm running on two very stylish, foot-shaped pillows. You know how some shoes have a heel cup to keep your foot in place? These have a heel suggestion, a gentle nudge that basically says, \"Your foot should probably stay here, but hey, if it wants to slip around, that's cool too.\"\u200bAnd let's talk about the midsole. I'm not a podiatrist, but I'm pretty sure a shoe's midsole is supposed to provide a stable foundation, not an expanding one. These shoes have a tragic flaw: the midsole has decided to spread out like a happy-go-lucky house guest who's gotten a little too comfortable on the couch. Every time I take a step, I can feel the shoe itself surrendering to the laws of physics, widening and flattening out under the sheer weight of my disappointment.\u200bI waited too long to return them, a classic rookie mistake. I was too optimistic, hoping that with each run, they would somehow magically transform into the supportive shoes they were pretending to be. They did not. Instead, they just got worse, which is honestly impressive. So, would I purchase them again? Not unless I'm training for a clown marathon where oversized, floppy footwear is a requirement. Would I recommend them? Only to my worst enemy. You've been warned.",

The downside is that the sole wears extremely quickly.  Nike suggests the sole should last 300-500 miles before the shoe needs to be replaced.  In my experience at least, somewhere between 150-200 miles is when the sole starts to wear down to bare spots.  Could just be me, but I've tried other shoes and I get a much longer wear life before they need to be replaced, so I'm thinking it's the materials of construction.  As I say they are comfortable, and I keep buying them, I just usually buy two pairs at a time since I know they won't last long.",

We tried everything we could think of to get the squeaking to stop but nothing has worked. Nobody wants to wear shoes that squeaks when you walk/run around in a gym or hallway. I figured since he had already worn them several times that we probably wouldn\u2019t be able to return them so we never tried. Also, the outsole toe part that wraps up came unglued within a couple months which makes me think that even though they are Nike, the quality isn\u2019t any better than other cheaper brands we have purchased in the past.

Shoes fit to size, great stability (at a cost below) have great toe box up front for those with big toes.  Great support on sides of feet, and using my orthotics give wonderful run support needed for dummies like me who jumped off things alot when young and feet are flat.  Within 4 miles these shoes felt really good on the treads.  Good weight room support and strong support on 1k rows.  My last shoes started really giving out on the rower, noticed that first.  But these feel really well formed and allow lots of power push on rower.  Only thing I do not like....  The same plastic bands that give such good side foot support is exceptionally painful on lateral lunges.... like being stuck with a stick...  Hopefully the plastic will flex better as it breaks in, as we all know OTF feels about lunges is like Rick Astley... Never gonna give you up.....",

He has been wearing them for months, and they still look & feel like new.  They are totally fashionable, but most of all, they offer extreme comfort that you just can't find in other sneakers.  The fit is true to size,  but most MEN can go up 1/2 size for the best comfort you've ever felt.  The Fashion & Comfort factors are 100 stars!!!  (And btw, my 90 year old dad also LOVES wearing Nike Tanjuns, and his 73 yr old wife too!  Proof that these are not just for 18 yr olds! :)  Best to wait & get them when the price is equal or lower than shopping at DSW or other online shoe stores.  Enjoy!",

I get a lot of compliments on its looks.Fit: I wear a 9.5 Wide, typical shoe size. However, on my work out shoes I usually go up to a size 10. I need the extra toe box width. This size 10 feels a little tight to begin with, but it does stretch out pretty quickly. I did order a 10.5 on one pair and it opened up the toe box, but is a little loose.Durability: The tread is not very deep, so I find that I am wearing the grooves out in my major contact areas pretty quickly. I am getting about 90 days of everyday workout use before the certain areas are slick. The shoe is still very serviceable, so it gets relegated to a walking or casual shoe.Value: I could sometimes get this shoe for under $60. That for me is a great value. Similar shoes go for around $120 in my experience.I would highly recommend for an indoor gym / cross training shoe",

The shoes are extremely comfortable, offering a secure yet flexible fit that adapts well during both lifting and conditioning workouts. What stood out the most is how easy they were to break in\u2014practically no adjustment period was needed. Within the first couple of sessions, they already felt like a natural extension of my training routine.The breathability is another strong point; the mesh upper keeps my feet cool even during long, high-intensity workouts. The stability in the heel gives confidence under heavier lifts, while the forefoot remains flexible enough for sprints, jumps, and dynamic movements. It\u2019s a rare balance of support and comfort that makes the Metcon 6 Free versatile for both strength and functional training.Overall, this shoe delivers on all fronts: comfort, stability, and ease of use. If you want a training shoe that won\u2019t slow you down with a long break-in period, the Metcon 6 Free is a solid choice.",

I really put my workout sneakers through the ringer; using them 7-days a week for weight training and cardio (3.5 miles/day of incline treadmill). Aside from comfort, being lightweight, and accommodating wider feet (unlike version 5 of the same sneaker), what really stands out about these is their versatility. I've never had a workout sneaker (metcon, running sneaker, powerlifting shoe) that has provided ample stability to perform barbell squats while also being comfortable, flexible, and lightweight enough to do an hour of cardio in. I wish that they lasted me slightly longer than 5 months, but considering what I put them through, these are great value for the money. I've purchased 5 total pairs of these and would recommend to anyone for almost any application.",

The Nike Metcon 6 feel much more stabile and confidently perform through a variety of activities.

I now wear higher no-show socks, but every couple of days, if the socks don't sit exactly right, the shoes still rub to the point of blisters.  It's almost as if the heel is TOO reinforced/stiff.

        "review": "I am very happy with this purchase. I intend to keep the shoes & use them for the gym and PT. I am unsure If I will use them on the court for Pickleball however, or other sports however.  They seem more aesthetic than sports effective.  There is not much arch support. They are the same caliber as the Cole Haan  tennis shoes which are actually good & much better than Dooney & Burke which are definitely aesthetically designed.  The leather on the Nike is EXCELLENT.  Much better than the brands I just mentioned.  I could tell by the way they buckled  to conform to the crease of my foot on the first wear without breaking. They will definitely hold up a lot longer than most brands I have had. I am happy with the fit & was able to adjust the laces to fit the extra width of my feet satisfactorily which is not always the case.  Some brands cut the width short @ the base & before letting the shoe widen out to save $.  Nike did not do this & I was very happy with being able to adjust the fit.  The heel padding is EXCELLENT ALSO. This shoe fit durability, quality, sizing, fit, heel padding, leather quality, ease of cleaning, true to description & aesthetically pleasing! The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that These qualities were all so good that the arch support did not compare to their definite 5 rating.  So what could have been an overall 5 shoe in every category got uncharacteristically, almost unfairly downgraded to a 4 because of one  category\u2026. Arch support.  If all shoes could say that they would be 5\u2019s. I guess this is a rather critical review if all the categories are 5 except one.  I hope this is helpful.",

They\u2019re very comfortable right out of the box, with good cushioning and support that make them easy to wear all day. On top of that, the design is sleek and modern, so they work just as well for casual wear as they do for workouts.I also appreciate the variety of styles and sizes that Under Armour offers. It made it easy to find the right fit and a look I really like. The build quality feels solid too \u2014 the stitching, materials, and overall construction seem durable, which gives me confidence they\u2019ll hold up well over time.Overall, a great mix of comfort, style, and durability. Definitely recommend these sneakers!",

        "review": "These sneakers are a reflection of quality. They're a great product, and for me, what stands out most is their comfort. They're very comfortable, especially in the back of the foot, which is very padded. They're also made with excellent materials and seem durable for the long term. Overall, the sneakers are well-made and very light. They don't feel heavy at all; all the details are well-cared for.As for aesthetics, it depends more on each person's personal taste, but I loved the very modern and youthful design. In general, products from this brand tend to have good designs. As for the size, it was exactly what I ordered. I think you should follow the advice given in the product description. For example, I'm a size 10.5, but they advise ordering one size larger than your normal size. So, I ordered size 11.5, and the truth is, they fit me very well. For my first online shoe purchase, it was a good idea, since that's one of the disadvantages of buying shoes online: not being able to test if they fit properly.The price I paid for what I got was fair, and I would definitely buy them again.",

        "review": "I have worn Saucony running shoes for 40 years, and have never gone wrong with a pair. My first pair was orange and garish, but on sale at an outlet. I was a poor college student training for a 1/2 marathon, and bought what I could afford. From then on it was love at first step. Like all the other Saucony shoes in my past, the Saucony Women's Cohesion 14 Road Running Shoe (what a mouthful) is a delight. I normally wear a women's size 9, but have a wide foot, so ordered a 9.5 US in this shoe. Good fit, good arch support, no rub at the back of the heel, nice stability against ankle roll on irregular terrain, nice sole cushion for heel strike and follow through, good flexibility at the bend of the metatarsal-toe joints. Good breathability...no sweaty feet after prolonged use (I prefer wearing socks). I'm not the fastest runner/walker on the block anymore, but these shoes still allow me to get out there and try. Plus, the black/grey/blue color scheme is attractive, even when wearing with casual slacks or jeans.Update, several years later: My previous pair of Saucony Cohesion 14 shoes are ready to retire. After regular use for several years, the front sole is beginning to peel back and my great toes are pushing forward in the toe box while running, wearing this area thin. I lace the shoes loose to help widen the toe box, and agree with other reviewers that the Saucony toe box on this shoe is more narrow than in past decades (I've worn Saucony brand for running since early 1980's). To adjust for the narrower design and different manufacturer, I ordered up from a size 9.5 to a size 10. I was skeptical that a size 10 would work because I normally wear a 9.5 running shoe. Right out of the box the new size 10's feel ok. My great toes are a full index-finger width back from the front end of the toe (see attached photo). This is comfortable. However the heel area is a bit loose compared to the size 9.5. I wear socks with these shoes, but as yet don't know if the heel will slip when running uneven terrain. The photos show the old size 9.5 (grey/blue) shoes compared to the new size 10 (blue/light blue) shoes. The length difference is barely perceptible, and the new shoes show the slimmer toe box. Just be aware that you may want to size up or go to a wide size for comfort. Still a good shoe for the price.",

They fit great with socks on if I would\u2019ve gotten an 8 in men these would be EVEN more comfortable and better. Style and color is EVERYTHING I could ask for in a sneaker that not a lot of ppl own. Can\u2019t speak on durability or wearability but I\u2019m sure they will do great.

These shoes are an absolute showstopper! The color combination is clean, bold, and modern. The light blue gives off a cool, fresh vibe while the black and white details add the perfect contrast for a sleek finish.Comfort-wise, they're exactly what you'd expect from Jordans \u2014 top-tier. The cushioning feels great for everyday wear or even on the days we spend too much time on our feet, and the support around the ankle gives me confidence in every step. You can tell the quality is there, from the stitching to the materials used.Whether you're a sneakerhead, a casual wearer, or just looking for a standout pair of kicks, these Jordans deliver. I\u2019ve gotten compliments every time I wear them. Stylish, comfortable, and built to last \u2014 what more could you want?Highly recommend!",

Also, the section in the heel that appears to be clear or otherwise translucent is actually solid black. Otherwise a good purchase, but maybe a little expensive for what they are. Incidentally, I have found some truly amazing articles of clothing on Amazon over the years, but lately a lot of what I have received has looked drastically different than what was pictured, often with the same listings on the site for years with no updates as presumably the products change. But I digress. In short, these Pumas have good arch support, are very comfortable, and feel good for picking up the pace on what little working out I do.

This is a very comfortable shoe with a Gel insert, so your steps are pretty cushioned and light. H O W E V E R, THERE ARE TOE-HOLES ON MY SHOES NOW!  To get an idea of the usage for wear and tear, I've used these shoes at the gym 5 days a week for 1.5 hrs for only the past 6 weeks - with only 25 minutes of that being cardio. I do not use these shoes for any other purpose.  I'm upset because these shoes wore out already! I'm not sure what type of resistance sneakers should withstand, but I can tell you that today I have shin splints (which I believe is because the insert has worn down) and I just noticed these toe holes!  For the record, I'm well groom with mani-pedi's so my toenail did not bust open this shoe!If you need this for the gym I do not suggest it unless you are ok with the life span and maybe alternate shoes.  However, if you just want a comfortable, cute set of kicks to hang out it, then you should show these guys off :)I get a lot of compliments!",

I will say that I\u2019m used to wearing cowboy boots and had to stop wearing them all the time due to medical reasons. But I am used to leather and leather-like items. But if you are not, these might feel warm if you wear them on a hot day. They have some airflow but they definitely aren\u2019t like a running shoe for air flow. Cowboy boots allow no air flow so I\u2019m used to it and I don\u2019t have a complaint about it. They also have a strong leather smell when they are new, which is not my favorite smell but I\u2019m used to it with cowboy boots again. But if you don\u2019t like the smell of leather it might be overpowering at first. Overall nice shoes that are comfortable and look nice that I wear everywhere I go now. They fit well and don\u2019t seem to untie themselves constantly like some shoes seem to. I wear them in wet grass all the time and they are waterproof in short grass. They have breathing holes across the top so if you step in a puddle that is over your shoe it will likely fill from the top and then you would have to take it off and actually dump it.

I've found them to be an excellent all-around shoe that provides comfort, style, and solid performance without a hefty price tag.\u200bThe \"Softride\" foam is the real star of the show here. The cushioning is incredibly comfortable right out of the box and provides a plush, responsive feel whether I'm walking, doing light jogging, or working out. It's a noticeable upgrade from many other shoes in this price range. The support and stability are also great for cross-training. The TPU cage gives you a locked-down feel, and the zoned rubber outsole provides reliable traction on a variety of surfaces, from gym floors to pavement.\u200bBeyond the performance, they simply look great. The sleek design and clean lines make them versatile enough to wear not just for the gym but also for casual everyday use. The fact that PUMA uses at least 30% recycled materials in the upper is a nice bonus and something I appreciate as a consumer.\u200bThe long-lasting comfort is why I keep coming back to this model. My first pair held up incredibly well to daily use, and I expect the same from this one. If you're looking for a shoe that's comfortable for all-day wear, performs well during a workout, and doesn't break the bank, the PUMA Softride Enzo 5 is a perfect choice. Highly recommended.",

I was and still am pleasantly surprised by what feels like a shoe that will hold up for the next 6 to 12 months at minimum as I put them through their paces ... not necessarily with what I had originally planned (trail hiking and running), but more so everyday life (work and play). I've tried some of the highest rated and more expensive shoes.  From a beginner running (9.5 min mile) standpoint and a person who tries to eat right and exercise everyday I would say that these shoes are a perfect fit for anybody's everyday activities. I work long 12-hour shifts and I'm constantly on my feet.  These shoes stood up to the time duration and did not cause my feet any discomfort.  They have just the right amount of padding, firmness and stability so that you feel confident with every step you take.  Granted I did not test these shoes in wet environments on varying surfaces (specifically smooth).  These shoes are said to be waterproof however I would probably caution people with regard to that and just say water resistant.  This is my first pair of Pumas and I am truly impressed.  For treadmill running I have a pair of Adizero Evos which are also fantastic but seem to be more environmentally limited due to their lack of semi cleated soles for outdoor running.  I'd highly recommend these Pumas as an everyday shoe.  They have served me well in varying environments including the rough sidewalks/streets of Tijuana MX.",

I purchased size 7 which is my reg size and same size as my old pair. My feet are not wide or narrow, these fit perfect. I actually bought a 3rd pair so I'll have them.

I will wear these this coming week, (a 50 hr week) and update as to wear, stretch, fit and how they feel. UPDATE: I have been wearing them over a month now.  These relaxed a little bit. I need to wear thin socks, rather than thick athletic type socks. They are holding up great and I am able to wear them for full shifts and more with no pain.

I got one foot out with extreme effort, took about 5 minutes, the other foot i actually had to cut slits to allow that part of the shoe to spread enough to pull my foot out.  That was after about 15 minutes of effort, no exaggeration.  Even tried using the shoe horn to try to get the foot out but that didn't work.

I was shocked but I am glad they made the mistake because now I can go back wearing a woman\u2019s shoe since I\u2019m a woman lol. Also, memory foam is very comfortable and my toes are not squashed. I am a big woman 5\u201910 - 265 lbs so they have to be comfortable and these are! I worked out in them today at the gym and my feet didn\u2019t swell or start to burn on the bottom when doing high intensity workouts like they always seem to do in other brand shoes. So thank you Puma for making this shoe for me. :)",

If you size up, the shoe will be too big. If you have a long big toe, there is simply no space between your big toe and the end of the shoe to make this shoe comfortable for running. The pressure is unbearable. There is also a defect in the right shoe, where a piece of fabric presses into the toenail of the big toe. These shoes could be good for running if they offered some space in the toe box and if the construction of the shoe itself was a bit less sloppy.",

Here\u2019s my honest experience:Clean, classic designThe Caven 2.0 features a sleek, retro-inspired silhouette that pairs easily with jeans, joggers, or casual shorts. The minimalist style works for both casual outings and everyday wear.Comfortable cushioningThe padded insole and soft lining provide excellent comfort for all-day use. Whether walking around the city or running errands, my feet stayed comfortable and supported.Durable constructionThe upper materials feel sturdy and well-made. The outsole offers good traction and grip on a variety of surfaces, adding to the overall durability.Versatile color optionsThe neutral tones and simple design make them easy to match with different outfits. They\u2019re a reliable go-to sneaker for any wardrobe.Lightweight feelDespite their sturdy build, these sneakers are surprisingly lightweight, reducing foot fatigue over long periods.Sizing runs slightly narrowIf you have wider feet, you may want to size up or try them on first for the best fit.Break-in periodThe leather-like material may feel a bit stiff initially. After a couple of wears, the sneakers soften and become more flexible.Not for high-performance sportsWhile great for everyday wear and light activity, these sneakers are designed more for lifestyle use than intense athletic performance.",

Sizing is true to size for other sneakers (except Nike because you have to size up in those). The quality is that of all Puma branded items in my opinion and excellent in craftsmanship and comfort.

I usually kow within a few steps if they are going to work or not. These by far are the most comfortable and great feeling and riding shoe that I own. Amazing to run in and they are more comfortable than any running shoe I have ever owned. If I had to pick just one shoe this would be the one. Great lockdown and unbelievable ride and no overlays over the toes to press or rub. All the reviews I watched and read on these shoes are spot on. Maybe not the best looking ones out there but I'd buy them again in a heartbeat.

After some research, excluding Nike that I no longer care to patronize, I ordered this pair of Pumas and a pair of Adidas.  Both had very good reviews by credible sources. After trying on both I went with these and have worn while walking the past couple weeks. They've been very comfortable and supportive and appear to be wearing very well even with the daily 2.5 miles on pavement. Actually I've noticed some discomfort on a few walks but believe it was due to lacing a little too tightly. Bottom line, I've pleased enough and think with continued wear these shoes and my feet will acclimate. I'd go 4-to-5 star if possible but rounding up optimistically.",

Planning to purchase more in other colors, once they go on sale.  It's a minor thing, but I really like the patterning of the rubber on the bottom; has almost a octopus sucker look to them.  It's the small details that can really make a difference.  I used to love the Saucony Original Jazz shoes, but they changed their sizing, and cut back on production.  These are a solid replacement.",

These shoes have quickly become my favorite pair for everyday wear and light workouts.Firstly, the design is sleek and modern. The Pacer Future sneakers have a streamlined silhouette that looks great with both athletic wear and casual outfits. The combination of mesh and synthetic overlays provides a lightweight feel while ensuring durability and support.Comfort is another standout feature of these shoes. The soft foam midsole offers excellent cushioning, making every step feel comfortable and springy. Whether I\u2019m walking around town or spending time at the gym, my feet feel supported and well-cushioned.The sneakers also offer good breathability, which helps keep my feet cool and dry, even during longer wear periods. This is particularly important for active days or warmer weather.Additionally, I appreciate the affordability of the PUMA Pacer Future sneakers. They provide excellent value for money without compromising on quality or style.Overall, I am highly satisfied with the PUMA Men\u2019s Pacer Future sneakers. They combine style, comfort, and affordability in one package, making them a great choice for anyone looking for versatile athletic shoes.

So a lot of time to test these out and break them in.The overall shoe is good. They play good, feel good, and look good.Because of the material they're durable and breathable. The memory foam insoles are really comfortable and my feet don't feel sore after wearing them for long periods of time. I've noticed no signs of wear, also my feet stay cool and don't feel like a swamp.The only problems I have with the shoes is that they are tight to put on and tight while wearing. They are true size to your foot so my feet have room to move around. Which is why I find it weird that they feel tight around my feet. Not unbearably tight though.If your looking for a good looking shoe thats durable and comfortable that also don't break the bank these are a good choice.Pros:-comfortable-durable-breathableCons:-tight to put on-tight when wearing",

    "Review": [
      {
        "review": "I just received these Puma Redon Bungee shoes today and they're exactly what I was looking for.Let me begin by debunking a few of the misconceptions about this shoe you'll find in other reviews here.  Apparently more than a few people did NOT realize what they were buying.  I saw complaints about the thin midsoles being uncomfortable to walk in all day.  Umm yeah, they weren't designed for walking.  And someone was complaining about the lack of arch support.  Once again, that is intentional.  This wasn't designed as a running shoe or a trainer.This is designed as a driving shoe.  It minimizes bulk.  So no bloated padded midsole like running shoes.  And outsole wear is not really a top priority so, the rubber outsole is thin too.  Also the sole is flat with zero heel drop unlike most running shoes.  And there is basically zero arch support on purpose.The reason for taking out all those \"features\" is to make a shoe that fits like a second skin.  Light, tightly fitted to your foot with no excess bulk to give you maximum space around the clutch, brake, and gas pedals in the car's footwell.  And that thin, flat midsole and outsole is designed to give you maximum feel of the pedals under your foot.  The rubber outsole is curved up the heel of the shoe for a reason, to prevent slip in your right foot when you are trying to heel and toe downshift a manual transmission.Can you wear these to walk from the car to a restaurant?  Sure.  Do you want to wear them to walk all day or for a 7 mile run?  No way.  These are a specialty shoe.  They are great on long drives.Puma sells to motorsports unlike most sneaker brands.  They have at least 3 other motorsports shoe lines, the Speed Cat, Drift Cat, and Future Cat.  But the Redon is the only one (I think) to offer a slip on bungee lace design.  I'm used to leather driving loafers for the street but those don't really look right with jeans or shorts.  So, I bought the Redon's as a casual driving shoe with the same slip on convenience a my leather driving loafers.  And truth be told, I'll use them as my house slippers too because they are easy to slide into or pop off.Another thing that may confuse people is that Puma also makes shoes for martial arts fighting on mats.  The Redon has a much of the same look as their fighting shoes.  Minimal bulk, skin tight fit, flat soles, rubber on the outside of the heel, light weight.  So it looks a lot like a fighting shoe which is another highly specialized product.So the Redon is not your usual casual sneaker or a running shoe.  But it's a really nice driving shoe that can be worn to walk a few blocks with no problem.  I like the clean minimalist look a lot.  I like the light weight.  I love the slip on feature.  And I love the thin sole that gives me great \"feel\" of what's under my foot.Another complaint I've seen here is the fit.  I wear a size 11D (medium width) in a running shoe so that's what I bought in the Redon Bungee.  They fit me fine in both length and width.  I didn't need to size up or down.  They are snug but easy to step into.  They feel secure on my feet but not so tight that they're annoying or painful.  But I'd advise anyone with wide feet to think twice about these.  They are made snug to work with the bungee lacing system.So all in all, I'm really happy with these driving shoes for the street.  At $40 they're a great value.  I may ditch leather driving moccasins altogether.",

I contacted Puma because I wanted to return them and have a replacement pair sent, but they informed me they had \"determined that there is no defect with this specific product that would qualify for a refund or reship.\" When I initially contacted them, they replied on October 22nd saying they would get back to me in 7-10 business days. They actually made me wait three full weeks (or 15 business days) before responding tonight (November 12th).

        "review": "Honestly one of the best shoes on the market for wide foot people, if your looking to snag a simple set of running sneakers, in my opinion. Here's some in-depth info along with  pro's and con's:TLDR: Great quality shoes for the price, and easy to clean. Recommend to beginner and intermediate runners/hikers, experts may be willing to pay more money for increase of quality.PROs:- Perfect Fit. I usually wear 9.0 wide (USA), so that is what I ordered and it fit perfectly.- Comfort and Ease. I like how comfortable they are and they are easy to slip on and off (if you wish) by the use of the heel pull tab. The tab also prevents the heel from getting bunched in or broken when putting on the shoes, which was a frequent problem with some other brands I have owned in the past.- Easy to Clean, Quality Mesh. I have seen some reviews saying these shoes wear out easily or the mesh is easier to damage. YMMV but I didn't seem to have this issue and I've had these shoes for about a year. IMO I find the mesh to be much more durable than the cloth mesh most sports shoes have these days and much easier to clean, which is essential for anyone like myself, who often hikes or runs in forestry/mud.- Above Average Quality. As for the year timeframe, the 1st set was about 8 months of extreme use, then I purchased a 2nd pair which I've had for about 3 months now. This may seem like a short timeframe to some but for me, I usually have to change shoes every 6 months or less if they are lower quality because they get a lot of mileage and use. I still have the 1st set which I use as \"lawn mowing shoes\", as they are still usable but the tread does not get much grip/traction anymore for running. I liked them enough to buy that 2nd pair instead of some other brand/model.- Decent Arch Support and Sole Tread. You will find other shoes with the same or better, but I didn't see many that were this cheap in price.- Part of Amazon's \"Try Before You Buy\". Free try-ons. You can take up to 6 days to decide whether to keep/return if you wish, and only be charged if not returned by the 7th day. Day 1 is the day they are delivered.- Uniform in Color. The shoe currently comes in all-black or all-white, including the logo. YMMV but this is a pro for me due to work restrictions requiring all-black shoes, so I can also wear them leisurely at work if I choose (I'm a mechanic). Great for anyone with the same issue, or military, etc.CONs:- Not the most expert/elite quality shoe out there, but will definitely check most people's boxes for average needs, imo.- Cost is higher than one might desire for just simple leisure shoes. But as an avid runner, the price is about average. However, they are usually on sale. My 1st set was around 40% off which dropped it from $70-something to $43, which was worth it for me. 2nd set was about 20% off. Winter holiday seems to be the best time for sales price.- Tread pattern is smooth and circular, instead of rigid and square/triangle, in case that matters to you (in regards to rock climbing etc)Overall I was surprisingly satisfied with this shoe model personally, but your mileage may vary.",

While the insoles of the Brooks are more cushioned,the width of these won out for overall comfort. These are sized more in line with my typical experience of shoe sizing. I ordered multiple Brooks to try on and none was a truly good fit.I'm going to be doing a lot of walking, so I may purchase an additional insert but for everyday wear they are more than adequate without an insert.I'm happy to find a new brand, that has a dependable sizing system.Shoe quality:The quality appears to be goodArch support:arch support is goodMaterial thickness:SubstantialColor:blackSlip resistance:hopefully good I haven't been able to test drive in wet surfaces yetLightweight:yes, lightweight",

I use an orthotic, and I expect to replace them a few times a year.  However, the MUCH more expensive brands broke down almost as quickly.  I keep a stash ahead, just in case Puma stops making these.  Sale prices are amazing - try the Puma site as well for their promotions.  I can wear the women's 8.5 as well as the men's 7.

Especially when running or doing a strength move that requires me to firmly plant my feet. I was hesitant with the mesh on the top of the shoe but so far I actually like the top design better (in my previous pumas the tongue always slipped to the side so I'd constantly have to retie my shoes)..",

It seems pretty durable as I haven't noticed any significant wear at this point. The stack height is definitely on the smaller side but it is very lightweight, making it great for workouts and racing. I personally wouldn't use this shoe for long runs or on rocky surfaces because it doesn't have much forefoot cushion (though the heel cushion is better), but I think it would work for pretty much anything else. Also, it's hard to beat this shoe price-wise. I got it for $45 and am considering buying a couple more!",

The leather upper gives them a premium look, and the overall construction feels solid and well-made. They work perfectly as lifestyle shoes and are great for running errands, light strolling, or just pairing with a laid-back outfit.However, do not buy these for running or high-impact activities. They\u2019re quite heavy and have an extremely soft, squishy sole that offers little to no responsiveness or support for running. Attempting to run in them feels unstable and could potentially lead to injury due to the lack of proper support and cushioning dynamics for that kind of movement.",

My only complaint is that the shoes run a little small. I wear a size 11. My new shoes state a size 11-12, but they are a tad short of that. I will deal with that for now. Otherwise, I'm pleased with my purchase!John.",

They were extremely popular in the late 70's and early 80's.  The design, fit and quality were really good.  But, somehow, they simply stopped making a great shoe, and the ones after the above time period were poor quality, looked cheap, were cheap, and ugly.  Not made nor designed for a man; more or less for a teenager and someone in their early 20's.  It was hard to find a classic Puma.  After searching, I did.They arrived today.  Perfect fit, comfortable, and a good-looking sleek, black pair of sneakers.I didn't buy these to rock climb, go jogging or for hiking etc.  I bought these for a casual sneaker: go to the gym, wear around sneaker.  Concerning the durability, I will have to wait and see.  If they last a few years, then I will be fine with that.  I suspect they will last longer because I have other sneakers for other type of wear.If you want a classic, clean looking, black pair of leather sneakers, with all the above I described, consider these.By the way, the size was perfect.",

I'm not sure of the type suede they are made of but it wears hard resists water and bleeding and cleans up nicely.These shoes have been around for decades , back when the tennis shoe was sold and made for playing tennis. Now they are much of a statement of your style as they are their utility.From gangsters to Lady Gaga This puma classic looks as good with the Mobsters velor tracksuit to a faded pair of Levi 501s on Sunday mornings.Construction Wise it's a lot of shoe for the money they wear hard and long. the soles are non-marring, the uppers glued and stitched. The matching color laces laces are extra wide and probably will last as long as the shoe itself, mine came with a pair of extra white laces should you not like the colored laces that they are shipped with.i wear a size 13 shoe , all Nikes are too narrow for me and some others such as Skechers are sometimes too wide this Puma seems true to size in this form.I have had a pair of the non classic leather tennis shoes that were a little bit narrow and constricted at the toe.In all fairness these fit perfect. Priced Right at $60 delivered on Amazon prime they come in several colors I'm sure you'll be pleased with whatever you choose,  so if you're on the fence get them you won't regret it.Warm regardsy Jerry and Honeycutt Jr.",

        "review": "I hate buying a pair of sneakers online that seem like such a great bargain, then they come in the mail and seem stiff, without any comfortable padding, and they just seem like terrible knock offs. I mean, the inside bottom sole isn't cushioned at all, and the sides walls of the sneaker aren't soft or cushioned at all either. Then it hits you, this is why these sneakers were cheap. BUT...these Pumas are not those cheaply made ones. The look great, they are truly classic Puma suede, and feel awesome on my feet. They are soft and padded nicely on the inside around the ankle and on the sole. As I stated in the headline, for $29.99, I should have bought multiple pairs! I love the grey/white look. I was watching these last year, and they dropped from $60 to $39. I wanted to purchase them last year, but didn't, and I was heart broken to see later that the price jumped back up to $60. My wife and I were sitting on the couch before this past Christmas, and she pointed out to me, \"aren't these the sneakers you were looking at awhile ago?\" She pointed out the incredible $29.99 price drop, and I \"clicked to buy\" immediately! If they offer them in other colors, still at that price, I might just get more!  In case you are wondering, I highly recommend these to any Puma lover, or anyone who loves great sneakers.  **Please note, I marked that these fit as expected. They fit as expected for a Puma sneaker. I have wide D sized foot. Pumas run a wee bit on the narrow side. These still fit great though**",

        "review": "Early review:  They arrived last night in a plastic bag not marked with a string or label like most new shoes.They are nice looking and I love the material. I work on my feet and have a spur on my heel that irritates my achilleas. I need a show with a raised heel but also extreme comfort to the soles. Recently a ganglion cyst formed on the top of my foot. It goes down when I am not wearing my comfortable but boxy Clogs work shoes.I needed something to match the comfort of my expensive Clogs but soft enough not to irritate the cyst on the top of my feet that was rubbing against the rubber rib eight hours a day. The price was a fourth of the price of the average professional work shoe.The Shoe came with a terrible insert and I changed them at once. They were lumpy, thin foam. The shoe fits snug around the toes but like a sock to the top of your feet. If you want to wear socks go up a half to a whole size.They fit and feel like wearing swimming socks with thick rubber soles of a running shoe.I wore them out for a few hours and decided thin socks would be needed due to sweaty feet without socks. One review said they were over hot. I did not find them so. A few reviews said they cramped the toes  and it was true at first, but not too bad. A co worker purchased the same shoes said she found the toes cramped but they took form later and is not longer an issue.I am on my feet for 8 hours straight and  10-18k steps a shift. Comfort is required. After my first night wearing them I love them. My toes were a bit tight at first but not too much. I never felt discomfort. I love the lift and the running shoes soles. It is like having the best of both worlds in socks across the top and strong soles together with a pleasant look. I strongly recommend these shoes and have to my co workers.On an extra note after a few days of wearing the shoes, the toes no longer feel tight.  I will be buying more colors to wear casually in place of my other tennis shoes.",

        "review": "Very unimpressed with packaging since I thought shoes would come in a box, instead they were just wrapped together in plastic wrap.  They did look new though so i unwrapped and WOW!  When I put them on, I didnt take them off until I went to bed.  They were so incredibly comfortable.  I have very fussy feet and so it\u2019s often times hard to find comfortable shoes for being on my feet or walking for long distances or several hours.  These are very light weight and should keep my feet cool enough in the  summer heat.  Since they do not have lacees, i wondered if my feet would be secure enough and stay in place, and they do.  My right foot pronates inward and this shoe seems to have the right support to keep my feet well aligned.  I highly recommend,",

        "review": "I have purchased two pairs of these shoes and both are wearable.On the first walk, I found the soles of shoes were slippery but after about five minutes they became resistant and have good traction on tile, carpet and sidewalks.Another reviewer stated that the shoes do not slip on easily and I agree.  They are hard to get on.  The sole thickening is 2.1 inch at the heel which makes it difficult to slip you heel in with having to tug on the back to pull them in position.  I don't mind because once they are on, they feel good and comfortable.  I wear them without socks all day with no discomfort.  They are very easy to get off.I wash mine after every use by removing the inner cushion and tossing them in the washer.  I place them outside to dry.  I have tried many of the other slip on walking shoes and for the price, I like these the best.",

These are the perfect shoe and she says the are very comfortable, plus they look good on. I highly recommend to anyone who wants the ease of putting on and no worries about untied laces. Material is sweater like and looks rich in this color.",

        "review": "I was excited to get some slip-on shoes since Sketchers decided to stop making their VERY nice Leather slip-on shoes. When I received these new shoes I ordered 3 of them since my size sells out fast. Two of the pairs this one was only in a plastic bag no shoe box. I was told they would be received all together in one order, NOPE; one pair came one day and so on! Hate it when that happens!I put the shoes on and they were larger than the normal 5.5 size. Your foot slipped forward and backwards in the shoe when walking, and then something odd happened. I turned a corner and my foot slipped right over the side of the shoe with damn near breaking my ankle. It shook me so bad that after that incident you had to be real conscious of foot placement for each foot. Making sure you carefully was square on the floor. My ankle still hurts and I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t fall with just having a total shoulder replacement. This shoe absolutely has NO ANKLE support! If you are light on your feet, have a hip replacement or shoulder replacement these shoes are NOT for you. They don\u2019t keep your feet from getting wet either. I wanted them as I can use only one arm to put shoes on. BUT who wants to wear them outside in the rain and get wet feet. The soles are made of \u201cHARD PLASTIC\u201d and they also slip on the carpet and floors. The inside of the shoe is also slick; they do however have good padding in them with arch support. Terrible design! Loved the Leather Sketchers Slip-On shoes with arch support and padding, but hate this bad yarn design. Just VERY disappointed! My doctor gave them a very bad review too! In the photo you can see the heal slips right over the side of the shoe.",

        "review": "The PUMA Attacanto Indoor Training Sneakers are an absolute game-changer for my kid\u2019s training sessions! From the moment we got them, I could tell these shoes were built for both performance and style.First off, the Electric Peppermint Black colorway is amazing\u2014bright and bold, but not too flashy, and it definitely stands out. My child loves how they look, and they\u2019ve received so many compliments! The sleek design with a pop of color makes them perfect for both indoor training and casual wear.In terms of comfort, these sneakers are top-notch. The fit is true to size, and the shoes offer excellent support. The cushioned insole and breathable upper keep their feet comfortable even after hours of movement, whether they\u2019re on the court or just running around. The rubber sole provides great grip, so no slipping during quick pivots or sprints.I also love how versatile they are. These sneakers are built to handle a range of indoor sports, from basketball to training drills. And they hold up really well, even with regular wear. My child says they feel light and responsive, which is great for agility.Overall, the PUMA Attacanto sneakers are a fantastic investment. They\u2019re stylish, durable, and offer the perfect balance of comfort and performance for active kids. Highly recommend!",

I wear a size eleven and this size twelve fits perfectly.  My first pair of Puma track/driving shows four years ago.  My first pair of Puma driving shoes lasted for four years of cycling before they started to fall apart.  For cycling (or driving) these shoes are really comfortable, fit great, have great quality, and the Velcro closures solve the only problem I had with my old Puma's - the shoelaces get caught in the bike gears.  I highly recommend this shoe to cyclists and drivers.Last notes\u2026  These are not shoes for anything other than short walking distances \u2013 they aren\u2019t designed for walking, they\u2019re designed for driving while seated, and in my case and others cycling while sitting.

These taper towards the front which completely eliminated the accidental accelerator presses. The sole is stiff enough to give you great feel and they\u2019re very light. They\u2019re not as breathable as I\u2019d like them to be but they\u2019re not bad. I\u2019ve worn them for several hours and never found them to be uncomfortable.

The combination of leather and suede in the upper gives them a sleek, retro-inspired look that pairs well with various outfits. The SoftFoam+ sockliner provides excellent cushioning, making them comfortable for extended periods of walking or standing.The fit is true to size, but if you have wider feet, you might consider going half a size up, as they have a slightly narrow profile. The rubber outsole offers good traction, and the overall construction feels durable and well-made.Overall, these sneakers strike a perfect balance between style and comfort.

        "review": "The material of the boot itself is thin in a good way. It feels one with my foot since it's a snug fit. The sole is thin so you feel close to the ground, but absolutely not flimsy. It's a full rubber sole and plenty grippy and flexible.They do run small and narrow, but I prefer tight and snug for soccer cleats because I make better and more reliable/predictable contact with the ball, and my feet stay planted and don't move within the shoe.Running shoes I size like regular shoes but lace them tight and snug. Soccer cleats I size them small and tight so that the boot/shoe itself is snug and not forced by laces which is difficult to tighten and also makes for pressure points...snug cleats don't cause pressure points and are easily snug without relying so much on laces, for me. These are great and well worth the $25!!I wear a 12 in Mizuno andSaucony running shoes, and 12 in these Pumas feels pretty damn tight on me on width and length. 12.5 may be better and I could probably wear them all day, but it'd still be unusually snug on the width...but that'd be good for soccer. The 12s on me I wore for 4 hours and my feet weren't hurting at all, but when I took them off, I enjoyed the feeling of them being off. My toes are pretty much at the very end of the toe box on these 12s, yet I have a comfortable gap on my running shoes. I'm keeping the 12s because they're so smug and great. I'll probably buy longer laces so I can loosen them more easily without difficult tying.I'm not regretting my purchase at all, just sharing my experience.",

However, my recent experience with a new pair in men's size 10.5, a size I've comfortably worn in other Puma styles, left me notably disappointed. These sneakers felt unusually tight and seemed to be undersized, a stark contrast to the reliable sizing I've come to expect from the brand.Initially, I held onto the hope that the shoes would stretch and conform to my feet after a period of breaking in. This optimism led me to keep the sneakers past the point of return. Regrettably, they did not improve in fit as I had hoped, which ultimately rendered them unwearable for me. Acknowledging my misjudgment in not returning them immediately, I've decided to donate the shoes to Goodwill.This experience serves as a reminder of the variability that can occur in manufacturing and the importance of addressing fit issues promptly. While this has been a setback in my history with Puma, it also highlights the need for careful consideration when trying new styles, even from brands we know and trust.",

I needed something that could handle both short gym sessions and constant wear\u2014from morning errands to evening walks\u2014and these have quickly become my go-to pair.What truly stands out is the enduring support. Many comfortable shoes feel great on day one but start to flatten out after a couple of weeks. These Energen Lux shoes have successfully retained their cushion and responsiveness, even with continuous daily use. The mid-sole provides a fantastic blend of softness for comfort and firmness for stability, which is essential for keeping feet and joints happy when you're on your feet for hours.The fit is true to size, and the upper mesh material is breathable without feeling flimsy. The construction is solid, showing no premature signs of wear on the sole or the upper fabric, which speaks volumes about their quality at this price point.If you are looking for a highly versatile, comfortable, and reliable sneaker that can transition effortlessly from a light workout shoe to a shoe you wear daily without losing its supportive feel, I highly recommend the Reebok Energen Lux.

BUT! They compromised on the uppers with making them under padded and somewhat stiff around the ankle and tongue.I would like to add that they run narrow in the midfoot but have ample room in the toe box. I have purchased wide shoes in brands like HOKA but these seem to run wide. Also, the cushioning is responsive and give good push off unlike the foam in shoes like the HOKA Clifton (which for me felt like running on a marshmallow).Overall, solid shoe 20 miles in and hope to get a couple Hundy out them.",

The entire upper is soft and tight, even the tongue, which makes it a great shoe for gym and sports. It is very light (by weight) compared to other sneakers. I'd say its good for summer, sports, running, but not for work or winter. The design and colors are great. There are some nice colors even in the female version that's worth checking out.",

        "review": "I love these tennis shoes. I was introduced to Brooks tennis shoes years ago, when I worked in the medical field; I fell in LOVE with my brooks, but certainly not the price tag. I saw these advertised on Amazon when searching for a new pair of tennis shoes, and as an avid purple lover, I just had to have these! I love the color; they\u2019re not too bright and not too dark, which means I can wear these with practically anything. I ordered these in a 6.5, since I typically wear a size 6.5-7. I will admit that they were a little tighter on the top. I\u2019m also 8 months pregnant, so I assumed it was from water retention, because they fit perfectly on other days. Although they don\u2019t fit like my Brooks, they\u2019re still very comfortable! Since I\u2019m in the final stages of my pregnancy, I still try to workout as much as I can; so far, they\u2019ve held up pretty well! Which, for $70, they should last awhile! They\u2019re very comfortable, durable, and lightweight, which are all very important to me when considering a shoe, especially since I practically live in them. I\u2019ve had them for a few months now, and although I haven\u2019t worn them enough to break them in, I have worn them enough times to give this honest review! They haven\u2019t left any blisters, and my feet didn\u2019t hurt while I adjusted to them. Overall, I\u2019d rate these tennis shoes a 4/5 for comfort, support, and functionality.",

Result is a more stable shoe with excellent ground contact. Not anchors or lifted like a lifting shoe and excellent side grip which gives it good lateral movement as well.Overall a stylish unicorn of a shoe that meets several needs of both weightlifting and aerobic activity.Obviously this all has trade-offs. Less toe spring and wider box means not as good of a running shoe as some others. Less heel and more flexible lateral movement means not a perfect squat shoe, but this is my pick for a weight lifter focused cross trainer that wants to fit in some cardio and calisthenics in the same workout without changing shoes.",

I\u2019m not a fan of the slits in the sole design, it has a thin layer is the bottom material, which makes me feel like it could peel easily. I guess time will tell (photo added ) . My experience with extra cushion shoes like these is they don\u2019t hold up for long term wear, usually about three months you can feel how they no longer have that bounce and feel different, almost like they go flat. This will result in knee foot and back pain. Yes I purchased them because of the cushion but only because I have been experiencing knee pain, and I have been walking more. I will add a review later after I have walked in them.",

        "review": "I bought these sneakers to replace a sub-$30.00 pair of Kirkland sneakers that I got at Costco five or six years ago.  That's a long time for a walking sneaker, but those things refused to die.  They were some of the best money that I ever spent on footwear.  They've been pretty much indestructible, and they had the most comfortable insoles that I've ever had the pleasure of experiencing.  I've replaced the insoles a couple of times, but now the sneakers are looking long in the tooth.  Time for a new pair.  Unfortunately, it seems they don't make those particular sneakers anymore.  If they do, I can't find them.After looking over Amazon, I found these.  I'm not interested in any \"fashion forward\" screwball looking sneakers.  I just want I nice regular pair of sneakers at a reasonable price.  I've had pretty good luck buying sneakers online.  I order a size twelve and they fit without issue.  I was a little surprised when I first tried these sneakers on and they felt a little snug.  I like a snug sneaker, but these almost felt undersized.  I'm strictly talking about the width here.  Length wise they're fine.  I've been wearing them for over a week now, and they are definitely starting to break in.  They do feel like they run a little on the snug side, so if you like your sneakers roomy, you may want to consider going up half a size.Pros:- These were listed at $48.00 when I ordered them.  That's a good deal.  Assuming they hold up.- They feel well made and appear to be good quality.  (I'll revisit this after I've had them for awhile.)- They look good.  Of course, this is a matter of taste, but I think they look really nice.Cons:- They're a little on the snug side.  Okay by me, you might feel differently.- Short tongue.  Should be 1/2\" to 1\" longer.How they feel on your feet is a matter of taste.  These are getting more comfortable as I where them.  That's a good thing.  I like a snug fit, because I feel that it gives me more support.  You may feel otherwise.  I wish the soles were a little wider for more lateral stability.  This is a matter of individual preference.  The insoles are the soft and spongy type.  They provide comfort, but not much support.  I like them, but I don't think they'll last very long.  Overall, I'm happy with these so far.  If they hold up, I'll probably come back and up the rating to five stars.",

        "review": "I've been ordering the same shoes (with some slight model variations) for work from the same manufacturer for years. I'll usually wear them until the seams come apart or the tread wears out. The tread seemed to wear out pretty fast with the last couple pairs I bought, so I thought I'd try these instead.Got them yesterday and put them on today. Nice looking shoe. I'm worried about glue breaking down and the seam eventually  coming apart around the toe, but I guess that may or may not happen- will update. I usually order a wide shoe but that wasn't avail for this shoe, so they fit kind of snug. Not too snug though- definitely workable and I'm sure they'll loosen up as I break them in. Lots of cushioning. In fact, they're almost bouncy.Only issue out of the box is they are incredibly noisy. They squeak and creek with every movement. On both hard and soft surfaces, as well as wet and dry surfaces.  Mostly from the arch and heel area. And it's LOUD. I can't remember ever having shoes this noisy. I really hope they get less noisy as I wear them.UPDATE: So over 3 weeks later, the left shoe has quieted down a lot. It's still a little noisy though. The right shoe has shown no change. It sounds like a duck with each step I take, and it's quite loud. Inside, outside, wet, dry, hard surface or soft, this shoe is LOUD.  It's the rubber tread/sole on the bottom of the shoe that makes the noise. I'm almost 60 and I've never had shoes with this type of issue before. I'm very disappointed that a major brand like Reebok uses such crappy materials in their product. I WILL NOT be purchasing from Reebok again.UPDATE 2: So here it is 2 months later, and the right shoe is still loud as heck. It's the tread and the way it moves when I walk. It like rubs up against itself somewhere and makes that squeaking sound. I wear the shoes to work 6 days/week so you'd think it would have stopped by now. The other day it was raining and these shoes got soaked. They were too wet to wear the next day so I wore my back-ups, which are my previous pair by another brand. I was immediately reminded how nice it was to walk without loud noises coming from my shoes. That's it. I'm throwing these away and ordering a pair of my regular brand. will not buy these again.",

Heel to toe drop is low which I like, barely noticeable. For me they have poor support due to their thin sole but are very comfortable and don't have too much cushioning like others I've tried.

The grip is reliable, and the materials are tough enough for daily wear in demanding environments.That said, after about a year of regular use, the original insoles started to wear down, and I noticed some foot fatigue.

        "review": "These are some fantastic work shoes. I bought them off the shoe truck in 2017 when I noticed a lot of co-workers wearing them, now retiring them for a new pair after 2 years in the warehouse.Lugging boots in and out of a sit down and stand up forklift all day can get tiring and even painful once the company starts requiring that mandatory 20 hours of OT at the end of the week. These things are so light weight, my top of foot pain has gone away. I'd actually gone jogging with them once...back in 2017.They have a decent amount of room in the toe area, never get any crowding. The cut-across design of the bottom of the shoe allows for extreme flexibility, meaning when you're squatting down to check that pallet label, the rear and sides of the shoe don't dig into your ankles as much. Pretty comfortable for an uncomfortable position.These things have kicked pallets, kicked boxes, kicked racks, forklifts and even a couple co-workers. I used the toe to drag pallets out on a daily basis, the mesh on top held up pretty well considering how wreckless I am with them.I tried a couple pairs of quality boots, a couple cheap pairs of steel toes from local department stores. These are much cooler and more comfortable than all of those. I'm a very warm mammal and get sweaty from time to time, switching from boots to these have eliminated that issue.The alloy toe means they're very light which is important if you're walking 15,000-20,000 steps a day while jumping in and out of equipment.I think two years is a bit longer than you'd want to stretch it, much of the padding in the heel had disappeared, but I wore these til the day my new ones were delivered with no issues.Adding an additional insole made these even more comfortable. I'm a big guy (240 lbs) so standing 10-12 hours, I need the extra cushion, but the included cushioning would probably suffice for those sit down forklift weeks.Gotta say, if you're on your feet all day and you haven't tried work shoes and have always been a boots person, you need to try these.",

        "review": "While if this was a normal shoe from me it would at least get a 4 star review based on its Comfort, Perceived Durability and Materials Makeup.This shoe will only recieve a 3 star review because of one category Slip Resistance.Slip Resistance - This shoe claims slip resistance. I'm not sure what this is actually for whether its for dirt or whether it's for oil. Typically I see it for oil.(Just a heads up I write this first for the people who depend on this category for work. I do not hate this shoe and rather like it)I will say that this shoe on normal ground (just like your average shoe) grips great but the moment oil is introduced you will start sliding. I work in a manufacturing environment for food where cooking oil is always around.I cannot help but slip all over the floors of my place of work even with the claim these shoes make. I give this category a 1 out of 5Comfort - This shoe is pretty comfortable I would give it a solid 4 out of 5 in that. I had to buy wide as the toe area squished my toes on the first pair I bought.It hugs your shoe but it does have some space between the top of your foot and the top of the shoe. Even after tieing it tightly. Also the Steel Toe in this show is not uncomfortable which is a plus.Percieved Durability - I will say that from what I can see after wearing them for a week is that this shoe will be very durable. It wont be prone to the side walls stretching out due to the reinforcement on the sides. Definitely a 4 out of 5 on thisMaterials Choice - I will say that everything on this shoe feels mostly premium. The mesh is good and not cheaply made and the steel toe is good.The only thing I will say badly about this is that the bottom of the shoe sole does not feel premium and it feels more like foam than it feels like rubber. I will give this a 3 out of 5.Good luck on your purchase. I do actually recommend this product if you wont be working in an oily environment as these will definitely keep your feet safe and comfortable.",

Honestly, I feel like I could climb a mountain, wrestle a bear, and then hit a CrossFit WOD all in the same day with these bad boys on my feet. \ud83d\udc3b\ud83c\udfcb\ufe0f\u200d\u2642\ufe0fFirst off, the comfort is unreal. It\u2019s like Reebok secretly hired a team of NASA scientists to design a shoe that hugs your feet like a clingy toddler. Whether I\u2019m lifting, running, or just strutting around pretending I\u2019m in a sneaker commercial, these kicks have me feeling unstoppable. \ud83d\udcaa\ud83d\ude80The grip? Let\u2019s just say I could probably run up a wall like Spider-Man if I really wanted to (I haven\u2019t tried... yet). They\u2019re stable enough to keep me grounded during squats but flexible enough to make burpees almost bearable. Almost.And let\u2019s not ignore the style. These shoes are so sleek that even my non-gym-going friends have been asking, \"Where\u2019d you get those?\" I\u2019ve caught myself looking down at my feet mid-workout and thinking, \"Damn, I look good.\" \ud83d\udc83\ud83d\udc5fBottom line: The Nano X4s are the Swiss Army knife of sneakers. If you want a shoe that screams, \u201cI\u2019m here to dominate this workout, but I also look cool doing it,\u201d these are for you. Reebok, you\u2019ve outdone yourself. My only complaint? Now I need them in every color. \ud83d\udd25",

These are some of the most cushioning shoes I've had.  Granted, I'm not on my feel all day, but I probably walk more than most office workers.Cons: Nothing significant.Other thoughts:These aren't \"sneakers\" in the way that they make you silent.  The bottom of the shoes are harder than my Nikes, and make a little bit of sound when you walk on a hard floor.  Not an issue unless you're an aspiring ninja.The bottom part of the shoe (the white piece) is larger than your feet.  This gives more stability, but makes your feet look a bit bigger than they are compared with my Nikes.The top of the shoes are breathable.  They are mesh rather than a simple fabric like my Nikes.  As a result, they don't stretch as much.  Just a personal preference which one you like more.Finally - this came in its original shoe box and the box was a bit squashed.

They have the right cushioning feel, which I think is important for staying injury-free.  Nice toe-box room, which is #2 on my priority list since I have sort of big feet with a size 13, and don't like a cramped toe feeling which sometimes happens.  Heel collar doesn't feel tight around my ankle, which can be a big negative for me as well. The price was very reasonable as well.  All in all, very satisfied.",

I can attest that these shoes have been pretty durable and still feel amazing half a year later. The area I live in has significant rain however I haven\u2019t had any issues with slipping. Reviews online have mentioned that these shoes are best for short runs (3-5 miles) but I regularly go on 8-10 mile runs in these shoes without any problem. And finally, aesthetic wise, I love the classic reebok style.",

I use them for running, walking, and a bit of hiking.Since they seem to have phased out the floatride 2s, I've shifted to floatride 3s.  Unfortunately, their \"lasts,\" however, vary a bit and range from normal American (Ds) to somewhat narrow fits.  I've tried three of these. The first and thrid were OK. However, the middle one was much narrower than usual, and the upper part of the heel is not well designed and irritates the heel, at least my heel. So, I had to send it back to Amazon.  The first and third models (including this black one), even of this particular line, fit perfectly.Although, I would say that the first one that I tried (a blue model) was the best of the three for fit etc.",

I personally use them for heavy squats and deadlift as they offer superior stability and support, also they feel so comfortable they can be worn for most exercises. Reebok has bridged the gap between barefoot shoes and workout shoes, weather you\u2019re looking for a casual shoes to wear to the gym that will give you great feel with the wider toe box to intense sessions of powerlifting and CrossFit these are to go shoes. They are flexible yet very well built and constructed from materials that will last and the pair are very light in weight that you will feel comfortable wearing for extended periods of time. When it comes to sizing these for me are true to size, I wear size 11 on the Reebok nano and I find the same size works for these. Reebok well done on these, most exciting shoe release of the year.One more point. Compared to other barefoot workout shoes or low stack height shoes these are perfectly priced compared to other who exaggerate their prices especially that these are made from higher quality material",

Shoe looks good other than branding. I would have preferred a gum colored huge \"Reebok\" if it's got to be there.I have a EE width foot with a large midfoot. The toebox was great, but the distal end of the laces is too far down IMO. The shoe rubs on top of my taller than normal foot at the crease. Removing the insole made the shoe fit perfect, but the shoe isn't made to use without the insole.Shoe seemed solid though. The upper material is nice and breathable. I was really close to keeping the shoe. If my midfoot wasn't abnormally large, i would have kept it.",

        "review": "First the good.  The shoe is lightweight.  Laces stay tied during long runs and the sole of the shoe is comfortable for the most part during runs.  If you are worried about the environment shoe is made from 50% plant based material.  What that exactly is, is not specified anywhere on the shoe.  My geuss would be cotton.  It feels like a canvas type shoe but not as soft.  Shoe fits well enough.  I tend to buy wider shoes but didn't have to with this shoe.  If you have a narrow foot, this shoe might be too big width wise.The bad.  The insole of this shoe does not remove.  It's also just a flat piece glued into the shoe and one could easily add their favorite insole on top and hopefully not lose much space inside the show.  The shoe is made with a rougher material.  Similar to canvas.  Unfortunately there is no additional padding around the Achilles' heel portion of the shoe and the heel tab part of the shoe rides up a little higher than most and doesn't have a notch.  Which leads to my biggest issue.  For me running with this shoe with no-show socks or no socks at all creates a rubbing action against my Achilles' heel and gets very raw and painful.  Even on a short run (3 miles) this becomes an issue.  I have to wear socks that completely cover this area in order to not have the issue.The rubber sole is very thin and seems to be wearing out quite rapidly.  I doubt I will get my normal use (around 500 miles light running) out of these running shoes.  These shoes may be better suited for walking.  I don't recommend them for running shoes because of the issues I observed.UPDATE:  Only used this for running about a month, switched it to a walking shoe and it pretty much fell a part very quickly.

I wore them for CrossFit, spinning lessons, cross-training, and weight lifting, and they were simply great. After a few workouts with these Nano ones, I'd like to share my experience.I'll be honest: I was impressed the first time I wore them for leg day. They have enough room in the toe box for weight lifting, are very sturdy, gave me no blisters, but I did notice my feet didn't feel completely comfortable, no arch support (like the CrossFit ones have), and the fit felt off.After a couple of weeks wearing them, my opinion has shifted. These are supposed to be good for cross-training, but if you are doing mild walking and/or prolonged standing with them, your feet will hurt on the toes and the heels. They are ok for weight lifting, considering the fit is not as great as the CrossFit ones, but definitely not for anything that includes walking. These shoes are NOT an improvement. The fit, the comfort, and the sturdiness are just not there. I remember being able to run and jump with the CrossFit ones, so I guess I'm just disappointed. I wish I had gone with the TYR ones.",

        "review": "First the good.  The shoe is lightweight.  Laces stay tied during long runs and the sole of the shoe is comfortable for the most part during runs.  If you are worried about the environment shoe is made from 50% plant based material.  What that exactly is, is not specified anywhere on the shoe.  My geuss would be cotton.  It feels like a canvas type shoe but not as soft.  Shoe fits well enough.  I tend to buy wider shoes but didn't have to with this shoe.  If you have a narrow foot, this shoe might be too big width wise.The bad.  The insole of this shoe does not remove.  It's also just a flat piece glued into the shoe and one could easily add their favorite insole on top and hopefully not lose much space inside the show.  The shoe is made with a rougher material.  Similar to canvas.  Unfortunately there is no additional padding around the Achilles' heel portion of the shoe and the heel tab part of the shoe rides up a little higher than most and doesn't have a notch.  Which leads to my biggest issue.  For me running with this shoe with no-show socks or no socks at all creates a rubbing action against my Achilles' heel and gets very raw and painful.  Even on a short run (3 miles) this becomes an issue.  I have to wear socks that completely cover this area in order to not have the issue.The rubber sole is very thin and seems to be wearing out quite rapidly.  I doubt I will get my normal use (around 500 miles light running) out of these running shoes.  These shoes may be better suited for walking.  I don't recommend them for running shoes because of the issues I observed.UPDATE:  Only used this for running about a month, switched it to a walking shoe and it pretty much fell a part very quickly.  Avoid this shoe, not worth the money.",

I've recently got Reebok Nfx Cross Trainer for walking purposes, but these Speed 22 TR are more comfortable, as it's more lightweight, it has wider design and better breathability (as Nfx Cross Trainer come with few mesh layers, for durability). For walking purposes, and likely running, I prefer these to Nfx Cross Trainer.Update. Took one star off since mesh lining at the heel counter wears out to the holes state surprisingly quickly.",

        "review": "Lemme first say, I\u2019m giving 4 stars because for the price, they are a well-made and clean looking, stylish shoe, they\u2019re just not the shoe for me and potentially not for you:First - as someone else said, they run a half size big, so size 1/2 DOWN. Otherwise the heel slippage will be bad on these (not enough of a heel \u201ccup\u201d to keep them on)Even with my own high arch insoles put in, these shoes are STILL not giving enough support against overpronation. And I don\u2019t even have a severe case! I\u2019m starting to get pains reminiscent of shin splints, JUST from walking around with these at work! There are 2 main issues that are causing me to invest in a better shoe:1. Lack of stability - this shoe wasn\u2019t advertised as a stability shoe, so I\u2019m not holding it against them. Just letting you know that if you\u2019re on the fence about these versus a proper stability shoe for your overpronation or arch issues, go for the stability shoe. Even just for casual walking, the support makes a difference.2. Poor \u201cflow\u201d from heel to toe - I think there\u2019s a proper term for this but I forget. Point is, even when walking (and I\u2019d imagine it\u2019d be worse when running), the shoe actually seems to hamper my heel-to-toe movement rather than help it. This is why I bumped down to 4 stars - no matter your foot type, the steps should feel smooth and they don\u2019t here.",

These shoes fit perfectly and are an exact fit. If you have rather wide feet these might not be for you. The colors are really good looking. This is an asteticly pleasing shoe if you are in it for the looks as well. If I saw these in a store I would have easily expected to pay70-80 dollars and they were only 43. Right out of the box I give these shoes a 9/10 just because I don't do cross fit. I say pull the plug if you want these. You won't be disappointed.

I work retail and do a lot of warehousing and I'm on my feet for about 8 hours a day, constantly walking, kicking doors, pushing heavy product across slippery warehouse floors, lifting, crunching boxes, etc.I think I would rate the grip-strength of the tread maybe about a 7 or 8 out of 10. You would probably have to go to an actual boot to do any better.After a full-day each day, my feet are not fatigued or sore with these shoes. They feel like a slightly heavier pair of tennis shoes and I hardly even notice that it has steel toes, but it does!I have not tried jogging in them yet, but so far they feel like another pair of high-quality tennis shoes. One unique thing that I discovered about these shoes the other day, was I had them laced up and needed to take one shoe off. It turns out that the fabric around the ankles has an elastic quality so it stretches so you can take your shoes off without having to untie them.Although, if I had to nit-pick, I would like the laces slightly shorter because the tongue of the shoe is completely fused with the shoes and there's no way to tuck your laces in. This is easy enough to change though.I give these shoes 5 stars!",

That said, they are still pounds lighter than the Keen safety toed boots I had prior.Great traction in the central NY winter parking lot trek, but mind they are not waterproof and the slush can creep in before getting through the door from the truck.The shoes are holding up very well at this point. I went out of pocket on these and am glad I did. I will buy another pair when these wear out. I'll update the review at that point, but I expect a good two years out them by how they are holding up.I do suggest getting a wide size for toe room, but that holds true with any steel toed shoe/boot, especially if one is prone to ingrown toenails or bunions.Also, I kinda like the fact that I don't wear the same shoes as everyone else in the plant and I get to offer the EHS folks a kick in the shin when they ask me if I have safety toes.. heh",

Uncomfortable as well along the outside portion of the foot on the inside of the shoe.Stability of the shoe is great.Cannot even walk in the shoe without heel slip. Because of this running would be entirely out of the question.The lace lock pull bungee system is entirely pointless because once you tighten it and do any exercises the force of your ankle hitting the bungee pulls the cord rendering the system entirely useless (unless you tie a knot in it of course but then you\u2019d have to get a very tight small knot out of an elastic thin tiny bungee cord)Hole opening for foot is big and poses no issues, I guess by that logic it\u2019s maybe too large creating too much of a gap allowing massive heal slip.I would suggest this show to very narrow footed individuals and people who don\u2019t plan on walking or running in them. Ie people doing more echo bike, skii erg, rowing, etc.I did not do rope climbs in them or plyometrics because I didn\u2019t think the shoes slipping off my feet in those exercises would be safe.These shoes look great and I had high hopes for them but they\u2019re just problematic to use for real training.I\u2019m 6\u20193\u201d 275 lb male normally wearing size 13 shoe in all shoes.

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is that they are a little bit larger (longer) than other major brands size 9. It may be that an 8.5 would be a better fit, but rather than return and exchange for 8.5 (and risk some other unexpected fit, like too narrow), I'll just live with the little bit of extra space in front of the toes. If you are trying to decide between 2 half sizes, you might want to choose the smaller size. That said, I don't know if the extra length is true throughout all the sizes. Maybe size 12 is spot on? However, if you are trying to decide 8.5 or 9, consider the 8.5. The size 9 are a little long.",

I was nervous that they wouldnt fit my feet given the reviews and even considered buying two sizes/sizing up - I'm glad I didnt. I am a size 8, but sometimes wear a 7.5 in larger shoes i.e. Merrells. In New Balances, I can wear either a 7.5 or 8 usually. I wear an 8 in tevas/old navy flip flops. This shoe is definitely narrow, but I have narrow feet! I actually tried an 8.5 on in person to see if I should size up and let me tell you - I had clown feet. The 8.5 was creepily long on me. So I ordered the size 8 here and they fit perfectly! They're the perfect length for my feet and I actually have a little bit of wiggle room around my ankles so they're easy to slip on and off w/out messing up i.e., crushing the back of the shoe or having to untie them. Longer shoe laces would be nice, but thats something I could get on my own. These shoes don't provide much arch support, but they're comfy for walking around and running errands/being on campus for the day. They do rub a little on the back ankle if you're wearing shorter socks so beware of that - I just wear ankle socks now.This is a super detailed review, but I wanted to actually give some pointers instead of labeling these as good/bad.",

They are light weight and well cushioned. My only caution and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is this.  The sides of the tongue are sewn onto the body of the sneaker so the opening is a little narrow and can't be expanded when you slide you foot in.  I think this would be a problem if you have a wide foot.  I have a more narrow foot so they are perfect for me.

I can just forget that I\u2019m wearing them. No sliding around or hitting a hard wall in the toe box. Just incredible! Heel protection is superb. Lateral stability is good with a natural feel. The insoles are unbelievably good. I usually change the insoles of my shoes because the originals never provide enough arch support, cushioning, or booth. These do a great job. They actually get thicker towards the heel to provide more cushioning but they are thinner in the front so the shoe feels connected to the floor. (I did actually try to replace the insoles with Dr. Scholls, which were marginally better in certain aspects, but they were obviously not designed for these particular shoes so overall they did not work as well together as the originals.) I was concerned about durability because of other reviews and I do see some wear after 2 months, but not more than other shoes I had. (For reference, I play pickleball at about 3.5-4.0 level twice a week.) I also really like the heel-to-toe drop, which makes them feel like sneakers and stretch my achilles/calf muscles noticeably less providing some relief.",

There does seem to be an inherent flaw in the design though because if you are using them to the max with quick collateral movements and hard play you will notice that they start to tear at a weak part on the outer edge towards the front of your foot. I\u2019d have to say for the price they should have been a bit more durable but a year later I\u2019m still using them, but I could imagine an advanced player running through these in a few months.",

The black pair is a size 2 and it has served for almost a year, still holds up nice, but getting smaller for her feet, so I got a new size 2.5 and 3. And will continue buying.

I was looking for something that was firm, thick soled, and preferably faux-leather-esque. These fit that bill to a T. All except for how incredibly narrow they were when I finally got them. I ordered a half size up, as someone who walks everywhere and for good amounts of distance each day, I thought maybe they'd be perfect. For a size 7 women's shoes, I struggled to get my whole foot inside, and even all the way in I was horribly uncomfortable. Walking did not help, in fact it made my arches aches something fierce.My excitement got the better of me, I'd waited months for the shoes to go on sale and when they did, just in time for my birthday, I jumped at the chance.Definitely order a size full size up or look for a wide version if available; especially if you're like me and walk everywhere.",

I started wearing them for the long walk during the strike, and didn't stop. Every few years I would buy an identical new pair to replace ones that were getting shabby. And then I couldn't find them any more, although from time to time  I'd search again. Well, here they are! I have been trying every sneaker--Hoka, On Cloud, cushioned Converse, you name it, I've tried but kept wishing for something less bulky, less crazy looking, more comfortable. These arrived today and they are just as I remember--perfect fit in my usual size, really comfortable, on and on. I'm ordering a couple more because I'm so afraid they'll disappear again. Also trying a high top version, which will be better for hiking. I feel like I'm finally ready to get back to traveling with extremely comfortable all-day walking shoes that could also go off road onto trails--or look ok in a restaurant.",

        "review": "In the last 6 months I have discovered that finding a pair of breathable hard toe shoes, that also are actually wide, and have arch support is apparently to much to ask.  I will admit I have an odd size foot at 11.5 4E, I've tried atleast 12 different brands now and to this point these shoes are the only one that comes close to fitting my size.  Most notably for me, they have a wide enough toe box that I can walk a lot and not get blisters, note that they are not perfect, however if you need some breathability as well these might be your best bet.  I also got the composite toe and it's been light enough not to really notice and does not set off metal detectors.Note:  if you have a flat or fallen arch the support may be great for you, that said if you have any arch, or like me have a decent arch you will want to like at getting an insert or additional support.  For this reason I've rated it a 4/5 stars, I have worn Reebok shoes before and these by far have the least comfortable insole of any I've worn before.  I think it has to do with the materials they used to help them be rated for industrial use, that said I still find it hard to beleive that Reebok would approve a shoe with such a lack of support.Overall, if your looking for a safety she that has a wide toe box, is breathable, and has a composite toe you probably wont find a better option.  I recommend using Amazon Wardrobe to try these out, I could not find anyone that had these in stock to try on and out city us a decent size.",

I wear a men's 12 or 13 depending on the brand and fit so I went with a 12 as I saw other reviews saying they run a little big. The toe area is wide (I don't have wide feet), of course that has more to do with the safety toe than anything, but the 12s length is still a little big on me too. They're not overly loose or uncomfortably big, just a little extra room than I probably would have chosen had I tried them on in a store, but not enough to justify returning them. They are the most \"normal\" looking safety toe shoes I've seen and I don't think most people would even notice unless I told them.

        "review": "Let me tell you about these shoes.  These run about 1/2 size too small. The width is accurate; however it is necessary to get the proper width because they don't give and relax like leather shoes .  The synthetic leather is sewn over a non giving Inner  \"shoe\".  That firm inner liner gives these gym shoes a lot of support and structure.  These will hold their shape for the life of the shoes.  They are very sturdy.  There is a band around the front of the shoe.  That gives additional structure.  They have a cushioned insole.  They have good arch support.  It supports exactly where it should on the arches. The tongue is padded and the heel area is padded.  The laces aren't overly long.  The gym shoes are lightweight.  On the feet, they look like good leather gym shoes.  They don't get those ugly creases in them.The insole is comfortable.  The synthetic leather is soft, but that is not felt because it is sewn over that inner shoe. The inner liner is soft, but firm.  The top of the shoe, before the laces have some \"play\".  That one area is softer. The rest of the  shoe is firm, non giving and will stay that way by design.  That's why getting the proper width is important.  The feet feel very supported.  These are nothing like those popular mesh gym shoes.Now, there are  two sole attached to these shoes. The first is flexible.  The second is not. It does not give.  It feels hard while walking.  The second sole is the one that is treaded.  It is deeply treadedThese shoes are not for running.  For anyone that has lost a lot of knee cartilage just know the last sole is  hard and inflexible.  If it wasn't,  these would be an absolute dream come true for anyone with knee issues.  Since it is so firm, initially they don't maneuver  easily in all directions while walking.  That's important for anyone with knee problems. They do absorb shock  and have lots of cushioning. The entire sole is almost 2\".  They are well worth trying, because they absorb so much shock and pressure off the knees  while walking. Note the photos;  the heel is designed so that  wearer has to heel strike first.  It's not an option. That is the proper way to begin walking.  That takes further pressure off the knee joint......I'm a Massage Therapist.I really don't think you will find a better shock absorbing shoe.  The more you walk in them the more thick cushioned sole is felt; the less the hard sole is felt,  and the feet are able to adjust to movement in all directions.  When first trying them on they just feel so hard.  That leaves after about a day of wearing.  After first trying them on my initial reactions was to send them right back.  Don't get discouraged when first trying them on.  Give them a chance. The knees will thank you.This is a good pair of shoes for people without knee problems for sure.  These make good works shoes  and they really look attractive, too.  I love the way they look, especially the all white.  It's a bright true white.  They look so fresh.  They make a nice  dress up gym shoe for me.  I know I'm glad I found them and I hope this review helps someone else.I purchased the white and black. For whatever reason the black runs a little smaller than the white.  I noticed that is true of Reebok's Princess Lite shoe as well.",

I bought 2 different brands, one of which was these shoes. I wore the other pair to work (where I am on my feet the most) and this pair to the gym. After a few weeks, I bought a second pair so that I could have a pair for work and the gym! This pair was superior to the other brand I bought (I\u2019m not naming the other brand because I don\u2019t have beef with them; I just love these Reeboks). My feet are not hurting at all like they were before buying these shoes! Plus they look great too! The quality and value for the price is unmatched in my opinion!The only things I will mention that some may not like, but that don\u2019t bother me at all, these shoes are a bit hot. They are fully lined, padded leather, which I think is super comfy, but they do get hot. But I have completely gotten use to that now. They are a bit narrow, so if you like a roomy toe box, you should try to find them in a wide version. I typically wear a size 7.5US in sneakers, but I got these in 7US and they fit great.",

I love the way they feel and they will be perfect for yard work.  I ordered a regular size 8 and they fit like a glove.I wanted a slightly different style for just plain walking, etc. so I ordered these.  I had read the other reviews about their being tight, but I completely disregarded them because I had already received the aforementioned pair which fit perfectly.  Also, I figured if these fit a little snug, I would stretch them out over time.  Last, the term \"X-wide\" left visions of clown shoes in my head.  Big mistake!When the regular size arrived last week, they were VERY tight.  There was no way I could have worn them for any length of time.  I had to send the regular size 8 ones of these back immediately and received the replacement size 8 X-wide ones today.  HUGE improvement!  They feel great, look great and will be perfect for my needs. If you normally wear a narrow size, these shoes will work for you.  Otherwise, order the X-wide!Love my new Reeboks and can't wait to hit the ground in them!",

If you\u2019re into classic silhouettes with a modern twist, these are a great choice.Style:The platform sole gives the traditional Club C design a fresh, elevated look\u2014literally. It adds just the right amount of height without feeling over-the-top. They pair well with everything from joggers and jeans to dresses and skirts, which makes them super versatile for casual or slightly dressed-up looks.Comfort:Surprisingly comfy for a platform sneaker. The cushioning is solid, and the shoe feels stable and supportive, even after a long day on your feet. I wouldn\u2019t call them ultra-lightweight, but they\u2019re definitely not clunky either.Fit:They run true to size in my experience. The leather upper is snug at first but breaks in nicely after a few wears. If you have wider feet, you might want to consider going half a size up, especially if you wear thick socks.Quality:Reebok did a great job with the materials\u2014good leather, clean stitching, and a durable sole that holds up well.

They receive positive feedback for their slip resistance, with one customer mentioning good grip to the ground. The build quality and sizing receive mixed reviews - while some find them nice, others complain about poor insoles, and while some say they run large, others report they're not true to size. The durability is concerning, with multiple customers reporting the shoes falling apart within weeks of use.",

In pretty much all other brand shoe I wear a 11 us size so bear that in mind when you purchase.  If you use the size guide and put in your normal size it will tell you the same size is recommended but do not do this as it will not be enough to room. Goe one size bigger for good toe room",

They grip to the ground, so I'm not slipping as much when I'm on, say like, a slicker surface, and it's a safety tip at the front. It's amazingGive this shoe a five out of five",

DO NOT BUY!!! 100$ FOR A PAIR OF STEEL TOE SHOES THAT LAST ONLY 2 WEEKS DOING WAREHOUSE WORK. IF YOU DO CONSTRUCTION THEY PROBABLY WOULDNT MAKE IT THEOUGH THE DAY!! These shoes are comfortable but after only 2 weeks of wearing them, they are coming apart at the bend of the shoe right after the steel toe cap! I work in a warehouse so im not even working in rough conditions or anything like that! I loved the look of the shoes and hoped they would last a while but 2 weeks after getting these I'm having to buy another pair!",
