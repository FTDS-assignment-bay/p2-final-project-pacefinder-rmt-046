Super comfortable daily shoes for me for the last few weeks, but there is a huge caveat: the toe boxes are low volume. The roof of the toe box is very close to the tops/knuckles of the toes. I tried my usual Saucony and NB size, 10.5, in store and did not notice the claustrophobic toe box. I ordered 10.5 on Amazon and wore them in the house but never could feel comfortable and figured they would drive me nuts! I tried 10 wide (not extra wide) and that gave my digits more breathing room, solving my problem. I made a good choice going down a half size, as I believe 10.5 wide would have been too big. The rest of the shoe does not seem to fit wide (admittedly I have not really worn wides before).Now that my toes can relax a bit I can appreciate the plush comfort of these babies. I like that the heel cups are not harsh or unforgiving, they are a little supple. I have been nursing both my Achilles tendons for a few weeks now‚Äîbreaking in Brooks Cascadia 16s on one hike nearly broke me!!I never notice the extended fins in back; I thought they might ‚Äúcatch‚Äù going down carpeted stairs, but no issue.I am almost ready to get back in the mountains with these and really test them (and my heels) out. I will mos def buy more when I see a deal. Hierro V7 are my new favorites and I have tried numerous Adidas, Saucony, Merrill, North Face, and Scarpa trail runners and hikers the last few months. Robust, comfortable, and look rad.Edit: I just did about an hour in the dry Boulder Flatirons at Chautauqua Park, and I love these shoes. The wides were barely big. I kept them fairly loose due to concerns with my Achilles and needing some extra give going uphill. Tightened them a bit just before descent, as usual, but didn‚Äôt wanna fiddle with them again. Can easily, comfortably lock them down a bit more next time.Comfortable on trail, very soft, you do feel big rock points and ground features underfoot, but I did not mind. These Hierros do not feel tall to me‚Äîgreat height/stack/drop that reminds me of my fave NB trail runners from 20 years ago. (I only wonder how they will hold up given how soft they are.)Edit: I now have three pairs of Hierros. Gotta say I would love some rock plate protection underneath as I have to be careful with foot placement on particularly pointy, sharp rocks (like 10% of the time on foothills trails). I occasionally trim down the hairy, wispy fibers that work their way out of the abrasion protection of the toe box. The shoes are all pretty easy to wipe down with a washcloth after a dusty hike.The Gore-Tex fit for me just like the regular V7. I thought I‚Äôd need to go up a half size like I often do for Gtx, but they were too big. Went back to 10 wide and they fit very well. You have to look at all the pix in the Amazon ad to see which are the Gtx (navy/black, crazy bright green!, and black/orange). I got the black with orange bottoms and have to say the orange is strangely close to pink‚Äînot the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù orange and black I expected. Not noticeable enough for me to exchange, though. They also have skinnier laces than the non-Gtx. The thicker laces work perfectly, but the skinny ones are a little finicky and knot up on me sometimes. GREAT shoes."

I would say they may run slightly large, and by that I mean length, not width. At any rate they are an excellent fit. However the premium part of these shoes for me is the density of the sole. Often shoes are described as walking on clouds but to me that means overly soft, these shoes have a firmness and give combination that is extremely comfortable for me. I‚Äôm shocked at how good they feel. One small note just to be fair, the insoles in these are suprizingly minimal. I‚Äôll probably replace them with something else. Also the drop, that‚Äôs the difference in the height of the heel and the forefoot feels like 0 which I like a lot, some running shoes have a huge drop and feel like you are walking downhill. I like these much better. Hope this helps. Oh one more thing, they are expensive but I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll get enough wear out of their quality to make up for the cost."

While some customers consider them an excellent value, others feel they're not worth the price.",Women Women,"I‚Äôm a recently retired, semi pro athlete, and I‚Äôm very picky about my footwear. I have a straight lasted, narrow foot; very neutral gait; normal arch and no structural or biomechanics abnormalities other than boney ankles. I bought these NB Hierro trail shoes in the low cut version and they turned out to be my favorite trail shoes ever! And they have great durability - after a year and a half of regular use, they‚Äôre still going strong (I alternate several pairs of shoes at a time to extend their mileage), but I‚Äôm soon ready to retire them to be yardwork shoes. So I wanted to try these with a slightly higher ankle to keep the dirt & debris out better. I was a bit nervous because my ankles are so boney, so high tops often dig in. But these don‚Äôt! üëèThese are truly waterproof and have a gusseted tongue. They‚Äôre very comfortable, responsive and cushioned - every bit as responsive and cushioned as the low cut version. They‚Äôre light weight and very grippy, but you can still feel the road/trail for agility. And I really love the colors! It‚Äôs a very cold gray, almost blueish grey. The lavender with dark pink accent colors are beautiful. They aren‚Äôt too dark to wear in the summer, and they‚Äôre attractive without being too bold so they don‚Äôt clash with most outfits. These aren‚Äôt nearly as hot as my winter hiking boots that are actual hiking boots and not just high top trail shoes. It‚Äôs so nice to have both!There‚Äôs only two negatives, which the low cut ones don‚Äôt have. The toe shield on these is just leather, not hardened for extra protection like the low cut version. And you do have to be careful about how you lace these because the tongue is just barely wide enough, and something can dig in if you don‚Äôt get it just right. I rethreaded one hole on the left shoe from under to over, and it‚Äôs much better.I still wear Nike Vomero‚Äôs on the road, but these are my favorites for the trails! üèÉüèª\u200d‚ôÄÔ∏èü•∞"

The Vibram Megagrip outsole offers fantastic traction, even on uneven or slippery surfaces, which gives me confidence on various terrains.

It took me a year to recover from shin splints after wearing the wrong shoes for too long (oops). The Kaias last for about 300 miles as the treadmill eats up the soles pretty badly, but I‚Äôll take to soft, flexible feel of the sole over a firm and unforgiving shoe any day. The sole is the only thing that ever shows wear and tear. Highly recommend if you‚Äôre a like-minded runner."

I did not need to do this for about three years with my first pair but lately began having some toe pain so I simply added added a gel arch under the regular insole and that easily solved the problem.I generally wear a 5 or 5.5 but a 6 fits me perfectly.

I usually change the insoles of my shoes because the originals never provide enough arch support, cushioning, or booth. These do a great job. They actually get thicker towards the heel to provide more cushioning but they are thinner in the front so the shoe feels connected to the floor. (I did actually try to replace the insoles with Dr. Scholls, which were marginally better in certain aspects, but they were obviously not designed for these particular shoes so overall they did not work as well together as the originals.)

If you‚Äôre into classic silhouettes with a modern twist, these are a great choice.Style:The platform sole gives the traditional Club C design a fresh, elevated look‚Äîliterally. It adds just the right amount of height without feeling over-the-top. They pair well with everything from joggers and jeans to dresses and skirts, which makes them super versatile for casual or slightly dressed-up looks.Comfort:Surprisingly comfy for a platform sneaker. The cushioning is solid, and the shoe feels stable and supportive, even after a long day on your feet. I wouldn‚Äôt call them ultra-lightweight, but they‚Äôre definitely not clunky either.Fit:They run true to size in my experience. The leather upper is snug at first but breaks in nicely after a few wears. If you have wider feet, you might want to consider going half a size up, especially if you wear thick socks.Quality:Reebok did a great job with the materials‚Äîgood leather, clean stitching, and a durable sole that holds up well. They‚Äôre easy to clean too, which is a bonus if you like that fresh-out-the-box look.Final Verdict:If you‚Äôre looking for a sneaker that balances retro vibes with a modern edge, the Reebok Club C Double Platform is a solid pick. Stylish, comfortable, and versatile‚Äîdefinitely worth it.‚∏ª"

I usually order the kaptir 1 or 2 and I ordered the 3 a few months ago. They were much narrower and the sizing was off in comparisons to the 1 and 2. Brooks running shoes started to give me a pain on top of my foot. Similar to a stress fracture. So got the 3 kaptir in the closet and ran and pain went away. I like a roomy toe box when running and these 3 are not that in comparison to 1 and 2. So I ordered half a size bigger in the kaptir 3 and then also ordered my normal size in the kaptir 4 and I‚Äôm very happy with the fit the comfort and the roomy toe box. Would say so far better than the 2. Haven‚Äôt ran with them yet but will. Overall this is a great shoe. Never again will I waste money on brooks. The bad thing is a shoe might feel good when you try them on in the store and then once you run in them and spend time on your feet in them then you find out whether the shoe is great, good or horrible. I do treadmill running and the best success I‚Äôve had with brands is adidas kaptir. New balance several pairs have been horrible, Pegasus 39 have been horrible for running but great walking shoe, numerous other adidas, one time a puma. So far adidas surpasses brooks, Nike, puma, new balance for running."

The fit is very good, the ankle support is not there is you plan on using these for cross training. However when it comes to walking they are great. They are extremely light, I mean lighter than canvas sneakers while at the same time providing a lot more cushion. If you are not used to these types of walking shoes it does take a little bit of time to get used to. It literally feels like you are walking on a memory foam mattress at first. After a couple of days I started to break them in. They feel great on asphalt, concrete, gravel, and even some uneven terrain. The price was reasonable when compared to other walking shoes with similar padding and construction. If you want to take up walking I would recommend this pair."

These also weigh in nice and light; likely getting the newer gens as time goes as a preferred tempo trainer."

Customers disagree on whether the shoes run true to size.",Women,"So I ordered these shoes back in late May because I needed new shoes for walking and own numerous pairs of Adidas sneakers. Well these caught my eye and were on sale for under $40 so obviously I bought them! Well when they arrived I tried them on and they literally looked like I was ready for the circus because they were so big. I wear a size 7 to a 7.5 in my fully enclosed shoes. Since I planned to wear thicker socks and a killer sale price I ordered a 7.5. Well these have to be a men‚Äôs size because they were so big but comfortable. Well I went to order a smaller size and was shocked that they were double the cost. So I returned them and ordered two other styles in 3 different sizes, only to keep one pair in a size 7. I still wanted these but at the $40 price point, so I watched and waited. While waiting, returning other pairs, and reading ALL reviews I had a better idea of the size that would probably work. Obviously the size chart wasn‚Äôt accurate and didn‚Äôt help the first time. Finally after after 2 months the price dropped and I ordered the replacement pair in a size 6.5. I tried them on and they are still a little big even with thick socks on but not bad enough for another return. A size 6 would be perfect with toe wiggle room but these will work. They are extremely padded especially around the Achilles tendon and ankle portion. The cushion almost has a ‚Äúgel‚Äù padding feel and surrounds the outer part of the foot. So my other pairs of Adidas sneakers range from a 5 to a 7! This brand doesn‚Äôt seem to be consistent with size but are worth it when you find your fit. These are noticeably heavier on then most sneakers but that is do to the really thick shock absorbing sole and the padding. However it‚Äôs not heavy enough for me to give up the comfort. I have clubbed toes on my left foot and this shoe doesn‚Äôt bother me. So in conclusion I went from a 7.5 down to a 6.5 and could‚Äôve easily worn a 6! So I would suggest sizing down at least a half size down minimal. I expect they‚Äôll last me at least a year or more easily with this being used as a primary daily shoe. So be prepared for a possible return or wearing thicker socks. I hope this helps and good luck with your purchase!"
