They are comfortably warm with mid weight socks in 85¬∞ but wouldn't be ideal for seriously warm summer hiking. The back of the ankle is taller than many shoes, which took some breaking in.

I have gone through at least 30 pairs. Before this one there was the 1122 and the 1121, both in various v versions. Once before, a new version was bad. The product got bad reviews and sales tanked. They then quickly fixed the problems and came out with a v2 version. This shoe series, along with Brooks ""The Beast"", are the 2 best shoes for people who may have planter fasciitis, use orthotics, are overweight and/or over pronate. It is built on the New Balance S2 last which produces a straight lasted shoe with extra room in the toe box. The extra room in the toe box is a big deal for people with diabetes, neuropathy, bunions, etc.I wear these shoes every day. I keep 3 pairs in service, wearing each pair every 3 days. This allows the foam in the soles to re-expand between wearings and keeps the foam soft and cushiony much longer. I put a new pair of shoes into service every 18 months, replacing the oldest pair with new ones.I could see immediately that the 1540v3 is a whole new design from the v2. I put on the shoes and wore them around the house all evening. I immediately noticed that the shoes do not have that wonderful, soft cushiony feel that I am accustomed too with a new pair of this series of shoes. The soles are much harder and have less cushioning. The main reason I replace these shoes is when they no longer have enough cushion in them. I can tell, because my feet will to hurt badly at the end of the day. So to start out with new shoes that already have hard soles is a non-starter for me.The second thing I noticed with the v3 is that I am feeling hard pressure points through the arch support area and also along the outside edges of the shoes. I think this is caused by the combination of my orthotic inserts and the harder soles of the shoes. The pressure points were bad enough to make my feet sore after wearing them around the house for a few hours. This is also a non-starter for me.The shoes also have completely re-designed outer soles and the shoes have a more solid feel when you plant your foot and walk forward. The shoes resist rolling to the inside or outside more than the v2s. I like this more solid feel, but time will tell whether this increases or decreases foot comfort.The length of this shoe is exactly the same as the v2 model. The toe box of the v3 has a little more room in it and feels less tight on the toes. The front of the v3 toe box now points inward a little unlike the v2 model which pointed straight ahead. This crowds the outside of the toes a little and could be a problem for people who have bunions. Bunions shift the toes towards the outside of the shoes and crowd the toes against the outside of the shoes. I do have small bunions, but with the wider toe box on the v3 model, I don\'t think it would be a problem for me. I think this change was made to make the shoes look more stylish, but could decrease comfort for some wearers.The shoes have more padding along the sides and rear of the ankles which makes them more comfortable in those areas.  I really like the new styling and colors of the gray and blue shoes. The uppers seem to be made of stronger, more durable materials that would resist staining.  These are all nice improvements. The main thing I have disliked about the previous models is that they seem to wear out to quickly for a shoe in this price range. The soles lose their cushioning and the outer soles seem to be made of a soft rubber that wears away too quickly, especially in the heels. Time will tell whether the v3\'s will last any longer.Because of the lack of cushioning in the soles, these shoes no longer work for me. I am going to try out a pair of the Brooks Addiction 14 which worked out pretty well for me when New Balance ruined the 1122 model some years ago. I  may also try out a New Balance 840v4 model. If others also find the soles too hard on the v3 model, we may be seeing a v4 coming out soon. In the mean time, I will be keeping my eye out for v2 shoes in my size and color.Update on July 2, 2021: I just saw an announcement that the 1540v4 shoes will be released in Oct. 2021. This, the V3 version, will start to show limited size availability and, shortly before the V4 is released, will be offered at big discounts. I hope the V4 goes back to a softer sole like the V2 version has. If so, I will likely start wearing them again. In other aspects, it is a very good shoe.', 'rating': '1.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': ""Based on the sizes shoe companies now market, I must have rare narrow feet.

Beyond that, they're well-made and look pretty good.  The relatively low stack height and minimal drop also contribute to their stability.

Would buy again.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'This is my first pair of New Balance running shoes. I\'ve been running for over 15 years and have mainly stuck with Asics and Brooks as my primary trainers. Obviously the 520\'s are a budget pair of running shoes and are not going to be as nice or as durable as a more expensive flagship pair, but I\'ve purchased many $40-60 Asics and these are fairly comparable. The 520 v8\'s are very light shoes with a neutral fit and a smooth tread. They make excellent racing shoes, but aren\'t a great option for longer distances. These shoes feel very stiff to me, more so than any of my Asics within this price range ($54). But take that with a grain of salt as my other pair of shoes right now are the Hoka Mach 5\'s ($160) that are by far the most comfortable, cushy shoes I\'ve ever had. These are a great light shoe for runs under 5-6 miles at a time. I\'ve found they start to lose cushion and get pretty hard after that. I tried a half marathon in these and wished I would have brought a second pair for the second half. They started to feel hard around mile 6 and by mile 8-9 they\'d lost all cushion.In terms of longevity, I don\'t see these shoes making it much past 250miles. But again as a budget pair, that stacks up to the competition. I\'ve been able to average around 300 miles in my ""cheaper"" Asics. They now have 100 miles on them, and so far they\'ve visibly held up well, but already have a permanent crease in the mid-sole. The tread is holding up great with slight wear on the toe. The mesh, laces, and even the interior are all holding up well with no wear holes in the heel. (Like every pair of Asics get) I do have some light staining on the mesh / outside of the shoe, but of course being such a light color that\'s going to happen with outdoor running in the winter.

These new ones are perfect in every way, absolute comfort, roominess, but snug enough fit with a good amount of comfort padding inside, and they have the exact size dimensions of the last size 15\'s I had from 5 to 6 years ago, maybe a slight tad wider for even better comfort. I love that they don\'t pronate (tilt to one side from overly spongy soles) and are even more stable for the ankle than the last ones. They also don\'t have excessive heel height which is a huge problem for me in this trend of making heels too high since i have ankle issues and had to have surgery on my feet at age 4, so I was told my my orthopedic doctor my feet could not handle excess sloping, i.e., higher heels. In this regard, it reminds me of barefoot shoes with a flatter more even profile, but still with good arch support and still perfect shock absorbing comfort (not excessive since I can\'t handle excess arches). Glad I came across the perfect fit shoe for me, though there is one thing I hope will last and that is four of the shoelace eyelets in the middle were done differently for stylistic reasons: they are put through some type of fabric loop instead of the leather that the other holes are made to go through. If those loops have stitching that fails at some point then one would have to resort to drilling a hole into the leather where it normally would go through because they had to do this ""cool"" looking style feature.

This has been fine for sneakers, and I even got a pair of NB hikers that have been working pretty great for me.My family and I love the beach, and every time we find ourselves shopping at the beach, I instinctively check the flip flop rack for something in a 14. To this day, I've never seen anything on those racks above a 13. So I went to Amazon, found a nice looking pair of flip flops, and the largest size they had was a 14. Figuring I could return if it didn't fit, I pulled the trigger. When I got them, I couldn't even get my toes past the straps. There is no way they were bigger than a 12!So I continued shopping the Amazon, and lo and behold, these New Balance slides showed up in my search results. Thinking they've never steered me wrong in the past (and I could return them again if they didn't fit), I decided to buy these in 14 X-wide.Like a lot of people said, they definitely need some breaking in. I just wore them around the house with socks on (never with socks in public though) for a few days, and they feel amazing now.

This could be specific to my foot shape, but I\'ve found that while it is wide enough to be comfortable, along the center it doesn\'t have  a wide enough base and my foot tends to rock inward as it lands. This leads to at least one of my feet becoming fatigued as that interior muscle along my arch tenses to make up for the lack of support.  If you have wide feet with little to no arch, this could be an issue for you as well.

Super comfortable daily shoes for me for the last few weeks, but there is a huge caveat: the toe boxes are low volume. The roof of the toe box is very close to the tops/knuckles of the toes. I tried my usual Saucony and NB  size, 10.5, in store and did not notice the claustrophobic toe box. I ordered 10.5 on Amazon and wore them in the house but never could feel comfortable and figured they would drive me nuts! I tried 10 wide (not extra wide) and that gave my digits more breathing room, solving my problem. I made a good choice going down a half size, as I believe 10.5 wide would have been too big.  The rest of the shoe does not seem to fit wide (admittedly I have not really worn wides before).Now that my toes can relax a bit I can appreciate the plush comfort of these babies. I like that the heel cups are not harsh or unforgiving, they are a little supple. I have been nursing both my Achilles tendons for a few weeks now‚Äîbreaking in Brooks Cascadia 16s on one hike nearly broke me!!I never notice the extended fins in back; I thought they might ‚Äúcatch‚Äù going down carpeted stairs, but no issue.I am almost ready to get back in the mountains with these and really test them (and my heels) out. I will mos def buy more when I see a deal. Hierro V7 are my new favorites and I have tried numerous Adidas, Saucony, Merrill, North Face, and Scarpa trail runners and hikers the last few months. Robust, comfortable, and look rad.Edit:  I just did about an hour in the dry Boulder Flatirons at Chautauqua Park, and I love these shoes. The wides were barely big. I kept them fairly loose due to concerns with my Achilles and needing some extra give going uphill. Tightened them a bit just before descent, as usual, but didn‚Äôt wanna fiddle with them again. Can easily, comfortably lock them down a bit more next time.Comfortable on trail, very soft, you do feel big rock points and ground features underfoot, but I did not mind. These Hierros do not feel tall to me‚Äîgreat height/stack/drop that reminds me of my fave NB trail runners from 20 years ago. (I only wonder how they will hold up given how soft they are.)Edit: I now have three pairs of Hierros. Gotta say I would love some rock plate protection underneath as I have to be careful with foot placement on particularly pointy, sharp rocks (like 10% of the time on foothills trails). I occasionally trim down the hairy, wispy fibers that work their way out of the abrasion protection of the toe box. The shoes are all pretty easy to wipe down with a washcloth after a dusty hike.The Gore-Tex fit for me just like the regular V7.  I thought I‚Äôd need to go up a half size like I often do for Gtx, but they were too big. Went back to 10 wide and they fit very well. You have to look at all the pix in the Amazon ad to see which are the Gtx (navy/black, crazy bright green!, and black/orange). I got the black with orange bottoms and have to say the orange is strangely close to pink‚Äînot the ‚Äúclassic‚Äù orange and black I expected. Not noticeable enough for me to exchange, though. They also have skinnier laces than the non-Gtx. The thicker laces work perfectly, but the skinny ones are a little finicky and knot up on me sometimes.

Growing up my Dad would buy us only ùôèùôÉùôÄ cheapest shoes he could find. They were so bad that we'd wear them out in a couple of months and I should be honest, I am not hard on my shoes, either (my older brother was a different story). Didn't make a difference. My Dad would rather buy us a pair of new shoes for $20 every couple months rather than spend $35 on ONE pair that would last at least a year (if not more). As a result, when I finally got a job and could buy my own, I had quite a collection. A habit I continue to this day.With that in mind, within the last year I've purchased 2 other pairs of New Balance trail running shoes which were (at that time) the most comfortable pairs of shoes I had ever purchased. Since then I bought a pair of Brooks Ghost Max which replaced those as the most comfortable pair of shoes I had ever owned.The Fresh Foam X have now replaced (by a slim margin) my Brooks for sheer comfort. I don't really run, but I DO an awful lot of hiking and walking. So strict comfort is pretty important to me. These shoes are simply brilliant in how comfortable they are. The previously mentioned New Balance Trail runners were, for a lack of a better term, had almost too much cushion. I know, how can a shoe have TOO much cushion? Well, those do...at least for me. For instance, I would never wear them for weight training, especially doing the dead lift. The cushion is SO pronounced that I'd be worried they could pull me off balance a little too easily. But then again, they aren't designed for weight lifting, so just keep that in mind.The Foam X shoes are a perfect balance between great cushion and sheer comfort. It must be hard for companies to achieve that balance without going too far but Kudo's to NB for pulling it off. The soles aren't as durable as the trail runners perhaps, but oh man are they a joy to wear. Again, since I don't run I cannot speak to how stable they'd be at doing any long/short distance running but man am I happy with mine.Overall ùôèùôÉùôÄ most comfortable shoes I own (and I own a LOT).

I feel like I got a premium trail running shoe without breaking the bank, which is always a win. My only minor critique, and it's a small one, is that they're a little tight on the side of my feet.

The shoes receive positive feedback for their appearance and fit, though opinions are mixed - while some find them comfortable during runs, others note the toe box being tight. Durability is also mixed, with some customers reporting good durability while others find them comparable to race shoes in terms of longevity.","{'review': 'I have two pairs of this shoe, I bought my first pair after trying them on in a store and I immediately loved the way they felt. I bought my second pair (pictured) from Amazon because the colors are nice, and I needed another pair to use exclusively outside of work. I\'m very tempted to buy a few other colors. My other pair is black and white, and I appreciate how the black is slightly purple and the white is slightly grey. Anyway, it\'s great these shoes caught my eye because they don\'t just look good. The soles have a soft cushiony feeling and the uppers live up to their name: ""FantomFit."" They are my favorite shoes for 12 hr shifts as a bedside RN, setting PRs in 1mi and 5k, and going out for food, drink, etc. Although these shoes are cushy, they are also responsive and fast. When running shorter distances I simple don\'t think much about them and they help me do my thing and yes it\'s in these shoes I broke my records for 1mi and 5k despite owning carbon shoes Nike Vaporfly 3 and Fuelcell Supercomp Elite v3. Probably because I\'m more likely to take these shoes out daily. There are however two things I don\'t like about these shoes: 1) the upper material seems prone to abrasion, and 2) I\'d get sore on long distance. I washed my 1st oair once and used a brush on the upper of the right shoe, little broken fabric filaments are now visible all over the upper hence I simply did not scrub the left one. In general both my pairs do not show much signs of other wear so I think the main thing is to not scrub the uppers. My second issue is that I could run more than 17.3 miles in these shoes. I had bad upper foot pain on two of my long runs in training for my first marathon in December 2024. I suspect, the upper foot pain may have been caused by form modifications from other pain on my soles then knees. Because of this the Adidas Adizero Adios Pro 3 won the toss-up for my marathon shoes. With that said, 17.3 miles is quite a long distance already and there could have been other factors that may have contributed to my pain. I must mention that the Adios is a dedicated road-running shoe and is more expensive. I wouldn\'t want to work a 12 hour shift in them because they feel funny when not running. I also must mention that these shoes are awesome on the treadmill as well as the road/sidewalk. While $140 isn\'t cheap, I consider it a good value for how good they are and how how they compare to more expensive shoes.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'Let me introduce you to the New Balance FuelCell Rebel v4 in Orange Beige (aka Hot Mango)‚Äîa shoe that doesn‚Äôt just support your training‚Ä¶ it dares you to push harder every time you lace up.From the moment I slid my foot into these, I knew this wasn‚Äôt just another daily trainer.

I thought it was going to be obtrusive.  After putting them on and checking them out I think they are rather complimentary and do not stick out at all.The materials used in these hikers are very good.  I sprayed water on the toe area and it beaded and ran right off, so they are waterproof as listed. Gore-tex rocks!! No one likes wet soggy feet while running and hiking around the country!!Arguably the best feature on this shoe is the locking lace hooks. The final top two lace hooks lock the lace in when you snap it in... great feature because you don't have to hold tension when tying the laces!!! My Merrell hiking boots do not have this feature and I am forever trying to hold them tension at the correct point while tying them. It's rather frustrating because it's hard to get them right... they either get tied too loose or too tight. Not so with these. Once you set the correct tension you simply lock the lace it and it gets held right there so you can tie the shoe with ease.I wear an 8.5 M... in every shoe I have ever bought,  so I bought an 8.5 M and in length they fit perfect. My foot is by no means wide but wearing mid-weight socks these kinda hug my foot and the toe box feels a bit restrictive. I much prefer a wider toe box to prevent toe issues and foot fatigue. So my only real complaint is that this may be an issue on long walks, runs or hikes. Also due to the materials used making these, I rather doubt they will stretch any.Overall, I am glad I decided to give these NB a try... they are more comfortable than my Salomon Speedcross 4s which for me are far too stiff in the soles and tire my feet out.I will keep this pair..."", 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'These are my favorite sneakers.

I guess the fresh foam refers to the bottom that you stand on. The phrase fresh reminds me of the 80's just like this scribble, paint design on the bottom of the shoe. I must've missed that in the picture. I found it ugly and immediately colored over that with a black market. So now I have spent almost $100 on shoes that I find to be rather uncomfortable and ugly. I've given it a couple weeks now and I can say these things: the toe protect is just a waterproof barrier but keeps toes from getting wet in puddles.  These do NOT qualify as slip resistant and will in fact send you skating . The main body of the shoe is net which I didn't notice when ordering. Not the warmest shoes for winter.

I‚Äôve had a few injuries and I‚Äôm not 29 any more, so I‚Äôm very picky about my shoes. I used to only run on roads for speed but do trails now that I‚Äôm retired from competing. This is my second pair of NB Hierro trail shoes. My first pair were v7 Gore-Tex, and they were the best trail shoes I ever had! They‚Äôre very comfortable, have enough cushioning &  protection, but I can still feel the ground which I like because they‚Äôre more agile. They‚Äôre light enough, and they look nice. And I love the toe protect! It has saved my toenails more than once. And both the cushioning and tread last incredibly long - longer than Nike and much longer than Brooks. I like these better than the Nike Pegasus trails because I felt my heels slip in the new Pegasus trails and because these have the toe protect and they last much longer, although I still prefer Nike Pegasus and Nike Vomero on the road.I like to have a second pair of both road and trail shoes to alternate each, and I only need one pair of each with Gore-Tex for when it‚Äôs wet because without GTX they‚Äôre more breathable and a tiny bit lighter. These v8 have a different tread than the v7 that is more grippy; otherwise they feel identical.The only thing I don‚Äôt like about these is that they‚Äôre wider than the last model, why do not to be a dealbreaker. I actually double check the box to make sure they didn‚Äôt send me the wrong width. I probably won‚Äôt buy them again because of this.These arrived in a super beat up New Balance box with torn paper. Fortunately, I don‚Äôt really care about that. They were sealed in a plastic bag and then in another box that was in perfect condition for shipping. The shoes themselves are fine, but I can tell they‚Äôve been tried on because the laces were twisted.

There is a huge amount of shoelace showing (is this supposed to be decorative?), and I prefer a shoe which is less shoelace, and more shoe material.

It's important that my weight be placed primarily in the heel and arch to minimize impact to my forefoot. Only the FuelCell Rebel V3s have resulted in zero soreness during and after a class. They are light and springy to boot. When I stand for a long period, I am aware that there is no pressure on the ball of my foot or toes (and why I don't feel pain or soreness).

It performs really well on body combat classes for high kicks and jumps, it does well on weight training, and it is almost good for HIIT.

I don\'t know who made these, but I\'m pretty sure their product development meeting went something like this: ""Okay, we need a running shoe that looks like a Nike, but is it a Nike? Absolutely not. Will it support your foot? No. Can you run in it? You can try. Should you try? Probably not.""\u200bThe lack of support is truly a work of art, a masterpiece of structural failure. It feels less like I\'m wearing a running shoe and more like I\'m running on two very stylish, foot-shaped pillows. You know how some shoes have a heel cup to keep your foot in place? These have a heel suggestion, a gentle nudge that basically says, ""Your foot should probably stay here, but hey, if it wants to slip around, that\'s cool too.""\u200bAnd let\'s talk about the midsole. I\'m not a podiatrist, but I\'m pretty sure a shoe\'s midsole is supposed to provide a stable foundation, not an expanding one. These shoes have a tragic flaw: the midsole has decided to spread out like a happy-go-lucky house guest who\'s gotten a little too comfortable on the couch. Every time I take a step, I can feel the shoe itself surrendering to the laws of physics, widening and flattening out under the sheer weight of my disappointment.\u200bI waited too long to return them, a classic rookie mistake. I was too optimistic, hoping that with each run, they would somehow magically transform into the supportive shoes they were pretending to be. They did not. Instead, they just got worse, which is honestly impressive. So, would I purchase them again? Not unless I\'m training for a clown marathon where oversized, floppy footwear is a requirement.

Next thing I knew I was lying there on the cold, hard sidewalk in such shock I layed there for what felt like forever. I slowly began to rise to my feet. I started to check myself for any injuries when suddenly I got a whiff of a nostril-burning foul smell. I reached my hand around to my back only to bring it right back abruptly.  I let out a loud scream followed by a gagging reaction to the dog poop that was now on my hand.  I ran to the grass and dropped to my knees I frantically began wiping my hand on the grass. As a tear ran down my face I remembered thinking can this day get any worse? Well, guess what it did! Behind me was a loud bark that scared me so much I jumped forward. I was now lying on the ground once more. As I got to my knees, I stood up quickly, eager to see the culprit that I believed to be the doggy doo doo bandit, but as I turned around to confront this demon, I promptly began to plead because in this dogs mouth was my other shoe I slowly began to approach this dog as I got close enough I made a daring move I tried to jump on the dog.

This has served me well for years to stop the squeak and it has the additional benefit of freshening up my shoes.I have tried numerous shoe brands over the years and the only shoe that came close to the comfort and stability of this shoe is the Strutter from Adidas, which is no longer made to my knowledge and didn\'t last as long anyway.One thing Nike could do better is to more firmlyvsecure the sole to the body of the shoe. The glue used by Nike to secure the rubber part of the sole is the first part of the shoe to fail, especially if these shoes get wet regularly from rain or wet grass or even puddles when going to and from your car and the gym classes. I can normally get 6 to 8 months out of the shoes and I have at least 8 one hour classes of various intensity a week (and I do my best to keep the bottoms dry!).For those who wear orthotics, these shoes take them well whether they are heel focused, toe focused, or cover the whole foot. I now wear Goodfeet orthotics and they are quite comfortable in this shoe.', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'I recently picked up these amazing shoes for my 11-year-old, who is super picky about both style and comfort.

At the time of this writing, that\'s almost 6 weeks. I\'d suggest when you are reading these reviews you keep in mind how long the reviewer has been trying out the shoes; it can take several weeks to fully get used to a new shoe and reviewers who give hasty reviews (either good or bad) are not giving you the real picture.____________________In a nutshell, I got these shoes so I didn\'t have to spend a bunch of money on running shoes AND gym shoes. Nor clutter up my closet with too many pairs of shoes.  After using them for over a month, I am surprisingly satisfied.First off....I\'m 6 foot and 175 lbs. My shoe size varies between 10.5 and 11 USA. My foot is slightly wide, with good arches.  I got these shoes in a size 11 and they fit great.  But not at first.....for the first 4-5 wearings they felt tight around the middle of my foot. At first I was disappointed and felt like they were not going to be a good fit. But after about a week of wearing them, they broke in just fine, and the fit now is great. I attribute the tight feeling to the plastic side braces that the shoestrings lace through: if you lace them overly tight, that will contribute to the uncomfortable feeling.My experience:  I have been running at least 3X a week for over 40 years. I\'ve weightlifted and/or cross trained on a regular basis for over 30 years. I have been a personal trainer in the past (certified by ACE). I\'ve run one of the toughest marathons in the world (Big Sur International Marathon), although I consider myself an average runner. I\'ve used everything from cheap $40.00 Big 5 shoes for running to $130.00 Brooks. I\'ve never bought a pair of shoes specifically for weight training or cross-fit workouts; I\'ve always used running shoes for that.Here\'s how I wear them:- running 1-2 times a week. My average run is around 2.5 miles, but I\'ve run up to 6 miles in them and they performed well. I would not recommend wearing these for regular runs longer than 3 miles because that\'s not what they are built for. I run mostly on pavement in California (moderate weather), although I just did a 6 mile run on trails in preparation for a 10K race later this month.  I feel like that was pushing the shoe to its limit, but it did fine.- stationary biking.- weight workouts. I do squats, standing barbell curls and overhead presses and these shoes are stable and don\'t shift. Of course you need to adjust the tightness of the laces depending on what you\'re doing and that\'s the cool thing about these - you can loosen them up a bit for non-critical exercises like stationary biking or tighten them up for running or squats.- kettle bell swings: again, they are stable and flexible.- burpees: this particular exercise really tests the stability, flexibility and shock-absorption of the shoe. If you\'ve never done a burpee, I suggest Googling it to see what the movements are. In this exercise the shoe is subjected to squats, kick-outs where I land on the toes as I do a push-up, then they flex as I bring my feet back under me and jump up into the air, forcing them to not only be stable in launching me up but in absorbing my return to earth.I work out in these shoes 6 days a week.  The photo shows them as of today, nearly 6 weeks into daily use.  I typically run a couple days a week, do burpees 2x a week, weight lift 2-3 times a week, kettle bell swing 2x a week and do moderate cardio such as stationary bike 1-2 times a week.I didn\'t buy these to replace running shoes; I got them to use as short-distance runners and gym shoes. You shouldn\'t get these if you are doing multiple runs of more than 3 miles in a week - they aren\'t going to give the performance and protection you need for serious running. But for gym work, cross fit training and shorter runs, they are great and can replace expensive running shoes.You should note that the plastic shoe lace-ups/brackets on the side of the shoe have 3 positions. The position closest to your toes is the least secure/loosest fitting style. Each hole you lace going back towards your heel tightens the shoe\'s grip on your foot.  I use the middle lace hole for running and burpees and the stability is fine.  I lace it all the way to the back hole for squats to make sure the shoe doesn\'t slip.I\'ve noted some reviewers say the ""sock"" collar around the ankle opening is loose.  I can say yes, it doesn\'t fit flush to your ankle when laced up, but that doesn\'t mean it slips! My foot is stable even if the sock appears to be loose-fitting. It isn\'t overly warm or hot, either (I was worried about that when I first got them).Again, if you\'re a serious runner I\'d invest in good running shoes and use these for the gym. But if you\'re a casual runner of shorter distances and fit in weight training and/or cross-fit training, these shoes do a great job.I\'ll close by saying that in the last 20 years or so I\'ve gotten wiser and have spent more money on running shoes, and with these shoes I\'ve gotten my first shoe specially designed for cross-training also. I am happy with the performance of the shoes so far. I\'ve never had a serious running injury, partially out of luck but largely because as my joints have gotten older I\'ve used better shoes.

My first pair has held up very well for me and have been washed several times so I feel good about the overall quality of the shoes.I have low arches and have had double bunion surgery many years ago so I usually exchange the insoles that come in shoes for insoles with an arch.  I did not need to do this for about three years with my first pair but lately began having some toe pain so I simply added added a gel arch under the regular insole and that easily solved the problem.I generally wear a 5 or 5.5 but a 6 fits me perfectly.

I intend to keep the shoes & use them for the gym and PT. I am unsure If I will use them on the court for Pickleball however, or other sports however.

They are the same caliber as the Cole Haan  tennis shoes which are actually good & much better than Dooney & Burke which are definitely aesthetically designed.  The leather on the Nike is EXCELLENT.  Much better than the brands I just mentioned.  I could tell by the way they buckled  to conform to the crease of my foot on the first wear without breaking. They will definitely hold up a lot longer than most brands I have had. I am happy with the fit & was able to adjust the laces to fit the extra width of my feet satisfactorily which is not always the case.  Some brands cut the width short @ the base & before letting the shoe widen out to save $.  Nike did not do this & I was very happy with being able to adjust the fit.  The heel padding is EXCELLENT ALSO. This shoe fit durability, quality, sizing, fit, heel padding, leather quality, ease of cleaning, true to description & aesthetically pleasing! The only reason I did not give it a 5 is that These qualities were all so good that the arch support did not compare to their definite 5 rating.

Soccer cleats I size them small and tight so that the boot/shoe itself is snug and not forced by laces which is difficult to tighten and also makes for pressure points...snug cleats don't cause pressure points and are easily snug without relying so much on laces, for me.

I\'ve found them to be an excellent all-around shoe that provides comfort, style, and solid performance without a hefty price tag.\u200bThe ""Softride"" foam is the real star of the show here. The cushioning is incredibly comfortable right out of the box and provides a plush, responsive feel whether I\'m walking, doing light jogging, or working out. It\'s a noticeable upgrade from many other shoes in this price range. The support and stability are also great for cross-training. The TPU cage gives you a locked-down feel, and the zoned rubber outsole provides reliable traction on a variety of surfaces, from gym floors to pavement.\u200bBeyond the performance, they simply look great. The sleek design and clean lines make them versatile enough to wear not just for the gym but also for casual everyday use. The fact that PUMA uses at least 30% recycled materials in the upper is a nice bonus and something I appreciate as a consumer.\u200bThe long-lasting comfort is why I keep coming back to this model. My first pair held up incredibly well to daily use, and I expect the same from this one.

The style receives positive feedback, and customers like the fit, with one mentioning they're not too narrow. The laces receive mixed reviews - while one customer appreciates the bungee cord design, others note that the elastic straps are not adjustable.","{'review': 'I just received these Puma Redon Bungee shoes today and they\'re exactly what I was looking for.Let me begin by debunking a few of the misconceptions about this shoe you\'ll find in other reviews here.  Apparently more than a few people did NOT realize what they were buying.  I saw complaints about the thin midsoles being uncomfortable to walk in all day.  Umm yeah, they weren\'t designed for walking.  And someone was complaining about the lack of arch support.  Once again, that is intentional.  This wasn\'t designed as a running shoe or a trainer.This is designed as a driving shoe.  It minimizes bulk.  So no bloated padded midsole like running shoes.  And outsole wear is not really a top priority so, the rubber outsole is thin too.  Also the sole is flat with zero heel drop unlike most running shoes.  And there is basically zero arch support on purpose.The reason for taking out all those ""features"" is to make a shoe that fits like a second skin.  Light, tightly fitted to your foot with no excess bulk to give you maximum space around the clutch, brake, and gas pedals in the car\'s footwell.  And that thin, flat midsole and outsole is designed to give you maximum feel of the pedals under your foot.  The rubber outsole is curved up the heel of the shoe for a reason, to prevent slip in your right foot when you are trying to heel and toe downshift a manual transmission.Can you wear these to walk from the car to a restaurant?  Sure.  Do you want to wear them to walk all day or for a 7 mile run?  No way.  These are a specialty shoe.  They are great on long drives.Puma sells to motorsports unlike most sneaker brands.  They have at least 3 other motorsports shoe lines, the Speed Cat, Drift Cat, and Future Cat.  But the Redon is the only one (I think) to offer a slip on bungee lace design.  I\'m used to leather driving loafers for the street but those don\'t really look right with jeans or shorts.  So, I bought the Redon\'s as a casual driving shoe with the same slip on convenience a my leather driving loafers.  And truth be told, I\'ll use them as my house slippers too because they are easy to slide into or pop off.Another thing that may confuse people is that Puma also makes shoes for martial arts fighting on mats.  The Redon has a much of the same look as their fighting shoes.  Minimal bulk, skin tight fit, flat soles, rubber on the outside of the heel, light weight.  So it looks a lot like a fighting shoe which is another highly specialized product.So the Redon is not your usual casual sneaker or a running shoe.  But it\'s a really nice driving shoe that can be worn to walk a few blocks with no problem.  I like the clean minimalist look a lot.  I like the light weight.  I love the slip on feature.  And I love the thin sole that gives me great ""feel"" of what\'s under my foot.Another complaint I\'ve seen here is the fit.  I wear a size 11D (medium width) in a running shoe so that\'s what I bought in the Redon Bungee.  They fit me fine in both length and width.  I didn\'t need to size up or down.  They are snug but easy to step into.  They feel secure on my feet but not so tight that they\'re annoying or painful.  But I\'d advise anyone with wide feet to think twice about these.  They are made snug to work with the bungee lacing system.So all in all, I\'m really happy with these driving shoes for the street.  At $40 they\'re a great value.

My first pair of Puma track/driving shows four years ago.  My first pair of Puma driving shoes lasted for four years of cycling before they started to fall apart.  For cycling (or driving) these shoes are really comfortable, fit great, have great quality, and the Velcro closures solve the only problem I had with my old Puma's - the shoelaces get caught in the bike gears.  I highly recommend this shoe to cyclists and drivers.Last notes‚Ä¶  These are not shoes for anything other than short walking distances ‚Äì they aren‚Äôt designed for walking, they‚Äôre designed for driving while seated, and in my case and others cycling while sitting.  And finally, the soles of this shoe can be very slippery when wet so take care."", 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': ""I use these shoes strictly for driving as I have a long commute and sometimes drive a windy road.

These things are so light weight, my top of foot pain has gone away. I'd actually gone jogging with them once...back in 2017.They have a decent amount of room in the toe area, never get any crowding. The cut-across design of the bottom of the shoe allows for extreme flexibility, meaning when you're squatting down to check that pallet label, the rear and sides of the shoe don't dig into your ankles as much. Pretty comfortable for an uncomfortable position.These things have kicked pallets, kicked boxes, kicked racks, forklifts and even a couple co-workers. I used the toe to drag pallets out on a daily basis, the mesh on top held up pretty well considering how wreckless I am with them.I tried a couple pairs of quality boots, a couple cheap pairs of steel toes from local department stores. These are much cooler and more comfortable than all of those. I'm a very warm mammal and get sweaty from time to time, switching from boots to these have eliminated that issue.The alloy toe means they're very light which is important if you're walking 15,000-20,000 steps a day while jumping in and out of equipment.I think two years is a bit longer than you'd want to stretch it, much of the padding in the heel had disappeared, but I wore these til the day my new ones were delivered with no issues.Adding an additional insole made these even more comfortable. I'm a big guy (240 lbs) so standing 10-12 hours, I need the extra cushion, but the included cushioning would probably suffice for those sit down forklift weeks.Gotta say, if you're on your feet all day and you haven't tried work shoes and have always been a boots person, you need to try these."", 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': ""While if this was a normal shoe from me it would at least get a 4 star review based on its Comfort, Perceived Durability and Materials Makeup.This shoe will only recieve a 3 star review because of one category Slip Resistance.Slip Resistance - This shoe claims slip resistance.

They\'ve been pretty much indestructible, and they had the most comfortable insoles that I\'ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing.

If they do, I can\'t find them.After looking over Amazon, I found these.  I\'m not interested in any ""fashion forward"" screwball looking sneakers.  I just want I nice regular pair of sneakers at a reasonable price.  I\'ve had pretty good luck buying sneakers online.  I order a size twelve and they fit without issue.  I was a little surprised when I first tried these sneakers on and they felt a little snug.  I like a snug sneaker, but these almost felt undersized.  I\'m strictly talking about the width here.  Length wise they\'re fine.  I\'ve been wearing them for over a week now, and they are definitely starting to break in.  They do feel like they run a little on the snug side, so if you like your sneakers roomy, you may want to consider going up half a size.Pros:- These were listed at $48.00 when I ordered them.  That\'s a good deal.  Assuming they hold up.- They feel well made and appear to be good quality.  (I\'ll revisit this after I\'ve had them for awhile.)- They look good.  Of course, this is a matter of taste, but I think they look really nice.Cons:- They\'re a little on the snug side.  Okay by me, you might feel differently.- Short tongue.  Should be 1/2"" to 1"" longer.How they feel on your feet is a matter of taste.  These are getting more comfortable as I where them.  That\'s a good thing.  I like a snug fit, because I feel that it gives me more support.  You may feel otherwise.  I wish the soles were a little wider for more lateral stability.  This is a matter of individual preference.  The insoles are the soft and spongy type.  They provide comfort, but not much support.  I like them, but I don\'t think they\'ll last very long.

I'm worried about glue breaking down and the seam eventually  coming apart around the toe, but I guess that may or may not happen- will update. I usually order a wide shoe but that wasn't avail for this shoe, so they fit kind of snug. Not too snug though- definitely workable and I'm sure they'll loosen up as I break them in. Lots of cushioning. In fact, they're almost bouncy.Only issue out of the box is they are incredibly noisy. They squeak and creek with every movement. On both hard and soft surfaces, as well as wet and dry surfaces.  Mostly from the arch and heel area. And it's LOUD. I can't remember ever having shoes this noisy. I really hope they get less noisy as I wear them.UPDATE: So over 3 weeks later, the left shoe has quieted down a lot. It's still a little noisy though. The right shoe has shown no change. It sounds like a duck with each step I take, and it's quite loud. Inside, outside, wet, dry, hard surface or soft, this shoe is LOUD.  It's the rubber tread/sole on the bottom of the shoe that makes the noise. I'm almost 60 and I've never had shoes with this type of issue before. I'm very disappointed that a major brand like Reebok uses such crappy materials in their product. I WILL NOT be purchasing from Reebok again.UPDATE 2: So here it is 2 months later, and the right shoe is still loud as heck. It's the tread and the way it moves when I walk. It like rubs up against itself somewhere and makes that squeaking sound. I wear the shoes to work 6 days/week so you'd think it would have stopped by now. The other day it was raining and these shoes got soaked. They were too wet to wear the next day so I wore my back-ups, which are my previous pair by another brand.

Most notably for me, they have a wide enough toe box that I can walk a lot and not get blisters, note that they are not perfect, however if you need some breathability as well these might be your best bet.  I also got the composite toe and it's been light enough not to really notice and does not set off metal detectors.Note:  if you have a flat or fallen arch the support may be great for you, that said if you have any arch, or like me have a decent arch you will want to like at getting an insert or additional support.  For this reason I've rated it a 4/5 stars, I have worn Reebok shoes before and these by far have the least comfortable insole of any I've worn before.  I think it has to do with the materials they used to help them be rated for industrial use, that said I still find it hard to beleive that Reebok would approve a shoe with such a lack of support.Overall, if your looking for a safety she that has a wide toe box, is breathable, and has a composite toe you probably wont find a better option.

The shoes offer good arch support and are considered good value for money. However, customers disagree on the fit, with some finding them too narrow. Moreover, the cushioning receives mixed reviews, with some finding them very cushiony while others say they're too stiff. Additionally, several customers report foot pain, particularly mentioning that they hurt their feet and cause knee discomfort.","{'review': 'Let me tell you about these shoes.  These run about 1/2 size too small. The width is accurate; however it is necessary to get the proper width because they don\'t give and relax like leather shoes .  The synthetic leather is sewn over a non giving Inner  ""shoe"".  That firm inner liner gives these gym shoes a lot of support and structure.  These will hold their shape for the life of the shoes.  They are very sturdy.  There is a band around the front of the shoe.  That gives additional structure.  They have a cushioned insole.  They have good arch support.  It supports exactly where it should on the arches. The tongue is padded and the heel area is padded.  The laces aren\'t overly long.  The gym shoes are lightweight.  On the feet, they look like good leather gym shoes.  They don\'t get those ugly creases in them.The insole is comfortable.  The synthetic leather is soft, but that is not felt because it is sewn over that inner shoe. The inner liner is soft, but firm.  The top of the shoe, before the laces have some ""play"".  That one area is softer. The rest of the  shoe is firm, non giving and will stay that way by design.  That\'s why getting the proper width is important.  The feet feel very supported.  These are nothing like those popular mesh gym shoes.Now, there are  two sole attached to these shoes. The first is flexible.  The second is not. It does not give.  It feels hard while walking.  The second sole is the one that is treaded.  It is deeply treadedThese shoes are not for running.  For anyone that has lost a lot of knee cartilage just know the last sole is  hard and inflexible.  If it wasn\'t,  these would be an absolute dream come true for anyone with knee issues.  Since it is so firm, initially they don\'t maneuver  easily in all directions while walking.  That\'s important for anyone with knee problems. They do absorb shock  and have lots of cushioning. The entire sole is almost 2"".  They are well worth trying, because they absorb so much shock and pressure off the knees  while walking. Note the photos;  the heel is designed so that  wearer has to heel strike first.  It\'s not an option. That is the proper way to begin walking.  That takes further pressure off the knee joint......I\'m a Massage Therapist.I really don\'t think you will find a better shock absorbing shoe.  The more you walk in them the more thick cushioned sole is felt; the less the hard sole is felt,  and the feet are able to adjust to movement in all directions.  When first trying them on they just feel so hard.  That leaves after about a day of wearing.  After first trying them on my initial reactions was to send them right back.  Don\'t get discouraged when first trying them on.  Give them a chance. The knees will thank you.This is a good pair of shoes for people without knee problems for sure.  These make good works shoes  and they really look attractive, too.  I love the way they look, especially the all white.  It\'s a bright true white.  They look so fresh.  They make a nice  dress up gym shoe for me.  I know I\'m glad I found them and I hope this review helps someone else.I purchased the white and black.

It adds just the right amount of height without feeling over-the-top. They pair well with everything from joggers and jeans to dresses and skirts, which makes them super versatile for casual or slightly dressed-up looks.Comfort:Surprisingly comfy for a platform sneaker. The cushioning is solid, and the shoe feels stable and supportive, even after a long day on your feet. I wouldn‚Äôt call them ultra-lightweight, but they‚Äôre definitely not clunky either.Fit:They run true to size in my experience. The leather upper is snug at first but breaks in nicely after a few wears. If you have wider feet, you might want to consider going half a size up, especially if you wear thick socks.Quality:Reebok did a great job with the materials‚Äîgood leather, clean stitching, and a durable sole that holds up well.

These were recommended on a women's health site. They are light weight and well cushioned. My only caution and the reason for 4 instead of 5 stars is this.  The sides of the tongue are sewn onto the body of the sneaker so the opening is a little narrow and can't be expanded when you slide you foot in.  I think this would be a problem if you have a wide foot.  I have a more narrow foot so they are perfect for me.

And I don‚Äôt even have a severe case! I‚Äôm starting to get pains reminiscent of shin splints, JUST from walking around with these at work! There are 2 main issues that are causing me to invest in a better shoe:1. Lack of stability - this shoe wasn‚Äôt advertised as a stability shoe, so I‚Äôm not holding it against them. Just letting you know that if you‚Äôre on the fence about these versus a proper stability shoe for your overpronation or arch issues, go for the stability shoe. Even just for casual walking, the support makes a difference.2. Poor ‚Äúflow‚Äù from heel to toe - I think there‚Äôs a proper term for this but I forget. Point is, even when walking (and I‚Äôd imagine it‚Äôd be worse when running), the shoe actually seems to hamper my heel-to-toe movement rather than help it.

The original web description was worded differently and it, along with Amazon‚Äôs product page, identifying the sizes as ‚ÄúWide‚Äù were what I\'d trusted and based my purchase on. The web search is misleading when one asks if this specific shoe model comes in ‚Äúwide‚Äù and this plus Amazon‚Äôs product page are wrong! The Adidas website does not have wide sizes either. Buyer beware.In my actual wear experience and going by the shoe tag and box, these shoes are not truly ‚Äúwide,‚Äù and they hurt my feet. I will notify Amazon to change the width to regular or standard, from ‚Äúwide.‚Äù__________Original review: I purchased these in size 6.5 Wide in Men\'s sizing. Amazon was the only carrier of the Wide version at the time. My typical women\'s size is 7 to 7.5 extra wide. I usually need an extra wide width due to two bilateral bunions, which make my feet sensitive with any pressure. My usual shoes are Brooks and New Balance. Runrepeat gave these shoes a high rating and, after reading their research about the toe box width, toe box height, great durability, and the customer reviews from other sites, I ordered these. I dislike spending full price, but this shoe brand and style/type (+ width) have sold quickly. They are my favorite sports shoes, stable, lightweight, and are comfortably cushioned. Worth the full price, imo. (See revised review above.)', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'Good. True to size', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'This is my 2nd pair.

And let me tell you if you can find the right size for this shoe, it's well worth the hassle if the shoe FITS.Fit & Sizing:Now in terms of fit I unfortunately had to try THREE different sizing, to summarize- I'm normally a UK 9 (US9.5), and I saw reviews to size up but it was WAY too big for me, then ordered a size US9.5 which was OKAY, but I did the shove toes to the front of the toe box while seeing how many fingers I can put into the heel.. And it was 2 fingers (supposed to be 1 finger snugly). I tested it out walking for a whole day for about 4 miles walk and I didn't feel any fatigue from that. But the fit just felt a little off, that the heel still felt loose. I could still fit 2 fingers when doing that test. So finally I ordered a size US8.5 and YES it fits, BUT the joint above the toes (Metatarsal area) feels a little bit tight at the moment.I will update this review if it breaks in well and whether I was a lunatic to not stick with my true size. Will break in and update.Breathability:Shoes are fairly breathable. It is by no means a jogging shoe like running shoes but it's not suffocating. I'm hoping that this will be an all season shoe for me and this feels like a good balance  for this fall and hopefully the winter.Color:Ultimate dad shoe vibes- love the 90s classic aesthetic and texture (I got the Cloud White/Charcoal/Putty Grey), I'm happy this will pair with my minimalist outfits and I enjoy the simplicity of this colorway. If you're a uniqlo fan this shoe fits the bill pretty well with a lot of fits.Additional notes/Durability:Do note that I really went in the deep end to discover and research the perfect shoe not just for everyday use but also using this for occasional hikes too- because the sole is lugged (4.5mm) and it should be good for casual, occasional hikes. And also Adidas has a partnership with Continental I can attest from another a pair of Ultra Boost that these soles last a very long time. So it's amazing in terms of value- just behind VIBRAM but the shoes that have that technology tends to be a lot more expensive depending on model, around 100-200usd and above (like Hoka pricing). So I expect this shoe to last a long time.Conclusion:Don't sleep on this model, it's very underrated right now especially if it's on sale. Try it and be wary of the sizing problems. I'd say go for your true size and be prepared to go a size down, and disclaimer that everyone's feet is different."", 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'very narrow in the toe box. recommend going up half a size. had to return mine', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'Very comfortable', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'These shoes are rugged and stylish‚Äîgreat for the trails and still nice enough to wear around town.

Yes, the price was a great deal and the shoes are comfortable and no tread is noticeably gone, but the dog shit on the bottom and a big spot on the top of one shoe‚Ä¶is just unacceptable. I have purchased things that were used before and have no problem with that, but after double checking myself, I realized that was not the case this time, with these shoes.*Pros- These Adidas are the second pair I‚Äôve bought, for the ease of slip-on feature and the option to purchase in a wide width‚Ä¶super convenient and very comfortable!

I do treadmill running and the best success I‚Äôve had with brands is adidas kaptir.

They have a nice wide heel with good stability which is good since he has some pronation in his feet. Also he doesn't often wear sandals because of his pronation, so occasionally wears sneakers without socks in the summer. These are so scratchy inside that would not be comfortable with these.

I did have an Adidas hiking shoe that was indestructible, but eventually wore out. I have been wearing Nike Pegasus for years. The Pegasus fit and feel is great, especially for a narrow foot. Price had become too costly, like most shoes. So after some time watching and reading reviews, I took a gamble on the Supernova Prima. Only a few days in to wearing, I have zero complaints. They feel like plush toys. Mind you, I walk; very little running, no high mileage, etc. just day to day wearing to work and for exercise.They are lightweight, and roomier than the Pegasus in the forefoot. I should also point out that they probably run a half size bigger. I wear a men's 12D. But I'm keeping these - colder months, room for thicker socks. The semi-gusseted tongue is also great; a soft, thin, pillowtop-esque portion of tongue is unique to this shoe. The upper is soft like a jersey feel. I wish the outsole was more like the waffle of a Nike or even had the Adidas Continental rubber, but not a dealbreaker.I put non-custom orthotics in mine. Heel feels cushiony and ball of foot is the same, bounce like.I'll admit the hyper turquoise accent color is awful. And if you go for the most current model, color selection is terrible. Not sure why Adidas would choose chain gang gray/highlighter and light communist gray as the 2 color options instead of anything else, but they did.If I can update review after 3 months, I can speak to durability.

The cushioning provides excellent comfort, absorbing the impact of each step, while the robust construction offers superior ankle and arch support, which is crucial for long days on the trail. One small note on sizing: I found that the sizing was a bit off, and I actually had to size down to get the perfect fit.I put these shoes through an extensive test, hiking between 8 and 11 miles each day through the rugged and rocky terrain of Estes Park.

I normally wear an eight or an 8 1/2 in hiking and running shoes. The first pair I bought were eights which I thought would be small enough. They were huge. I returned those for a 7 1/2. I have wide feet and even the 7 1/2 is a smidge large. I ran out of time for a trip and kept them instead of trying an even smaller size. I have plenty of room in the toe box. I can‚Äôt imagine these would work for anyone with narrow to maybe even moderately narrow feet. I also don‚Äôt have much arch. I wear Hoka Gaviotas- if you have those you‚Äôll love these.  If you can find the right fit, these are very comfortable right out of the box and a great hiker. I hiked in Costa Rica in muddy and wet dirt and had zero issues. Grip and traction was great. There was no break-in needed-  no blisters or tired feet.  They cleaned up well. ( I do wish manufacturers would stop using white bottoms on hiking shoes. It‚Äôs a given you‚Äôll be in brown dirt- why white?) I also wore these all day traveling and in airports. Seriously comfy shoe.  I wasn‚Äôt a fan of the green color in the 8.5 - they looked a little garish. I wish all manufacturers had more neutral, natural colors.  I went to black in the second pair and much preferred that look albeit they‚Äôre  a little boring. If you have feet like mine shoe shopping can be really frustrating. I went to REI and many other stores before giving up and going to Amazon. (Oddly I didn‚Äôt find Hoka hikers comfortable. Too much arch) I do think it‚Äôs worth trying to find the right size in these because in the end if you have wide flattish feet these are great for trails and even day to day.

I took these out on a hour and 15 minute hike and only had mild pain. They performed very well on a variety of terrain. No slippage on sand, loose dirt, grass, or compact gravel, even in hills. There was minor slippage on loose rocksthat where about 1""-2"" diameter when going downhill. The shoe also seemed to give my weak ankles more support. There was one point where I slipped slightly and felt my ankle wanted to turn, however the shoe prevented it. My old hiking shoes don\'t come up high enough on the ankle and my foot would have turned over for sure. If you\'re someone who has feet that ache and seem to swell when you hike, I would recommend sticking to your normal size. Otherwise you might want to size down.

I bought the first pair two years ago to take on a vacation to France and they were so good that this year I bought another pair, for you guessed it, another European vacation. What initially attracted me to these is that they are subtle yet comfortable. Yes, you can wear whatever shoes you want but in Europe, people tend to dress better, and their shoes are less flamboyant but still comfortable for hours and miles of walking. The purple is very subdued, and I have no problem wearing these just about anywhere. They're an ideal travel shoe because they are lightweight, breathable and supportive, all while being a fantastic value for the price. The name Ultrabounce conjures up thoughts of springy marshmallow comfort. I would say that's not entirely accurate. Yes, the shoes are comfortable but they are not crazy soft (like Hoka or some of the other super cushioned options out there)  and I think that's a good thing; they're cushioned enough to be comfortable but supportive enough to take care of your feet. What I also like about them is the way they fit. I have notoriously difficult feet to fit; I have narrow feet with high arches. While many companies are embracing the wider is better, especially in the toebox, these Adidas Ultrabounce runners have a welcomed medium to slightly narrow fit, perfect for me. In terms of size, I wear a size 12 in Nike and Asics; an 11.5 in Brooks and the 11.5 in these fit me perfectly. So why only 4 stars? I'm being picky, the insole is very basic and could do with more arch support; also, and this is a small thing, the laces are really long, they could be a little shorter.

First day with them.From what I can tell they are an Adidas entry into the lifestyle shoe trend and borrow styling from 1970's running and track shoes.  I certainly wouldn't run with these, but as a daily wear shoes they kind of speak to, yes, I was a decent if mediocre track runner years ago and I still weekend warrior run into middle age and am doing ok with it (albeit with a separate, dedicated set of shoes).  If you flip these over the soles have circles that to me evoke the sockets that you would screw your metal track spikes into.I tried on the Adidas SL 72 RS, a more true to original lifestyle form of a once popular track shoe.  Those are tighter and maybe fit more like a pair you would lace up to run track with in school. These are a bit looser fitting, so perhaps a bit better for a daily wear.What is present on both is a canvas vinyl type material that is perhaps true to the heritage.  However, some wearers seem to not like how the material does not bend and flex along the more pliable suede overlays.  To me it's just a characteristic, but it's there.

My first reaction when I got the shoes was that they were very light, at first you kind of have to break them in. They may seem a bit snug and may hurt a little bit. Perhaps it hurted me more than others because I have flat feet. After a week when you break them in, they sort of shape to your feet. It will feel comfortable and you'll feel as light as a feather, the shoes are great for athletics and they are very aesthetically pleasing, more so I liked how the shoe was rather versatile. If I wanted to wear some chinos, or some casual wear it wouldn't look to bad infact it would play the part. what I absolutely loved about these sneakers is how you can simply slip them on, I always hated those sneakers that you had to untie and worry about the shoe getting creases and what not. I however found that after a while, the shoe felt like it was slipping off and that it may have expanded during the time I was wearing, again nothing too big but it felt like it grew about 1/2 over the time I had it.  This became my go to shoe whenever I was leaving, I didn't even dare look at the others as my feet had gone through so much uncomfort when I went back. The shoe can get rather slippery in the winter and on wet areas so you need to be careful there but it's not like they're meant to be used during the winter. One of the things that I disliked about the shoe is how I had to keep on tying the laces several times, perhaps this had to with the laces mainly but I felt like it was the shoe moving from place to place as it started to expand and stretch. During the shoes last dying dies, I start to get holes from the ongoing times I've worn it, I knew it wouldn't last the way I treated it but for $40+ I didn't very much care. I later discovered that the inside of the shoes is composed of mainly some kind of cardboard, kind of surprising how such a comfortable fit could be made from such cheap material.I would recommend these to a friend, perhaps you may not want to wear them as much as I did however if you plan on making them last but it's great and with a price like that. You can't really go wrong. Would I buy them again however, there are many other shoes in the market and I'm willing to try many and see where they take me but I will have flashbacks of all the events that I had with my pair of shoes. I never begun to adore a shoe like that, no matter how much damage and dirt and stretching it went through, it managed and still had an amazing authentic look."", 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'TL;DR: Great shoes, will mold to fit you like a glove, and last for at least a year of heavy use. Get the Samba Originals if you prefer a short tongue.About me: I\'m on my fourth pair of Samba Classics. In a row. I love this shoe, and I think you will too. That being said, here\'s what I think you need to know:I first started wearing these shoes because I needed something with a flat sole to dance in (I did musicals in high school, and I wore straight through a pair of running shoes), and I fell completely in love with them. I wear them 100% of the time when it isn\'t raining and there isn\'t snow on the ground. I have also worn them for their ""intended purpose"" - indoor soccer - and find they work great there too.I would DEFINITELY recommend these shoes for serious walking, dancing, or indoor soccer. NOTE WELL: they will mold to your feet as if you were born wearing them, and will change their appearance somewhat once broken in (the leather will look a lot less shiny, and will develop a flatter fit across your foot), in my opinion much for the better. Like all leather shoes, these have a break in period, and I find it\'s less than a week. Once broken in, they feel AWESOME, and last a very long time: my last three pairs lasted between 1 year and 1.5 years each, depending on the amount of walking I did (walking increased when I went to college). They\'re also very comfortable walking / standing shoes. I\'ve never gotten blisters or pains from them.I would NOT recommend these shoes for rain, snow, ice, hiking, or serious running. The flat sole, which makes them great for traction on flat, dry surfaces, falls short on all of these things. Since they are leather, they\'re fairly water resistant, and a coat of water repellent spray will make them very water resistant (and avoid winter salt water stains), but water WILL get in around the tongue, which is not attached at the sides, only at the front.These shoes tend to wear in two places: the interior heel (the back of the inside lining), which will develop holes if you\'re a fan of slipping your shoes on and off (which I don\'t recommend: these are leather, they\'re meant to be tied snug); and the sole, which will gradually wear toward smooth. I find that the sole and the upper wear at about the same rate: i.e. by the time the sole is worn to the point of noticeable slippage on wet surfaces, the shoes themselves look like they\'re ready to be replaced. If you don\'t care about these two factors (or you want a pair of old shoes to work in), they will basically last forever. I still use my first pair for construction, painting, and mowing the lawn. They\'re over four years old and the leather will probably outlast everything else in my life.These shoes are essentially identical to the Samba Originals, the difference being that these have a longer tongue. Some people don\'t like the tongue, which is reminiscent of soccer cleats, but I like it because it makes the shoes pop a bit more, and goes well with long casual pants, with which you can wear the tongue outside of the pants (the tongue is also not uncomfortable with shorts, especially after it gets bent forward a bit by being worn with long pants).', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'I got this pair of Adidas on sale, and I love them they are so comfy,  and pair with just about anything.

Even with my narrow feet, I had problems getting my foot into the shoe without a fair amount of effort assisted by a shoe horn. The band is relatively rigid and places a great deal of constriction in the midfoot area and along the inner arch of the foot. Once my foot is in the shoe, this constriction is very obvious and yet the heel/ankle area remain loose. This is a very non-anatomically sized shoe. The length appears to be true to fit, its just this midfoot band that is extremely uncomfortable. Also, the sole of this shoe is very stiff. It is not at all flexible unlike what you would normally expect in a casual slip on shoe. I was very disappointed as I liked the cosmetics of the shoe. Unfortunately, I have to say that this is one of the most uncomfortable shoes that I have ever purchased. I should have heeded the negative reviews that talked about how uncomfortable these shoes are. I just thought that it was because people had purchased the wrong size shoe. However, it is the construction and design of the shoe that makes it ill-fitting and uncomfortable. Perhaps that is why they are discounted so much. I have owned several pair of Adidas shoes (in the past they tended to fit well as they tended to accommodate narrower feet like mine). However, this is the first Adidas shoe style that I could not wear (in the proper 8.5 size) due to extreme discomfort.

The size runs slightly big so order down if your kids have smaller feet.Now for the not so good. The sole is more plasticky than grippy rubber.  I compare every shoes to Merrell since I consider them the benchmark.  Merrell use super soft grippy rubber soles.  In my opinion, it‚Äôs not the best value for your money at $70.

There are several color combos to order from and I debated about ordering the white with the fluorescent pink and yellow but white sneakers get so dirty and I knew they would be dirty in a week so I opted for the gray with purple combo.These sneakers are a tight knit, breathable mesh and the shoe is in one piece, no tongue, with man made leather eyestays with purple loops and tie laces. There is a high heel tab which makes putting them on a little easier although I have a pair of Adidas shoes with the high tab in the back and I needed to buy heel tab socks to prevent rubbing on the top of my heel, she wear ankle socks so it shouldn‚Äôt be a problem. There is also a heel reinforcement as well as an extra rubber tab at the toes although she is rough on sneakers so I am not sure these will help. The inner sole is their patented Cloudfoam for cushioning and these shoes have a decent arch as well. The sole is white with a touch of purple to match the shoes and it‚Äôs constructed of the typical foam soles you find in most sneakers these days, it feels hollow but it‚Äôs a lightweight synthetic foam rubber.These shoes are nicely constructed and my niece really likes the style of this shoe, it‚Äôs current and she even likes the grey and purple color combo  (she usually almost always picks out pink!). The price point is about average for brand name kids sneakers but these Kaptir Flow 2.0 sneakers are nice quality and my niece said they are super comfortable so the price is a good value.

I did NOT have to break them in, in any way whatsoever.  They were comfortable from the start (and let me add I have a small bunion, from my years of high heels, that apparently loved them too).  Oh, and occasionally I'd add a comfort pad if I knew it'd be a long day on my feet; but quite honestly, they're cushy soft anyway and found it was not necessary.

Well these caught my eye and were on sale for under $40 so obviously I bought them! Well when they arrived I tried them on and they literally looked like I was ready for the circus because they were so big. I wear a size 7 to a 7.5 in my fully enclosed shoes. Since I planned to wear thicker socks and a killer sale price I ordered a 7.5. Well these have to be a men‚Äôs size because they were so big but comfortable. Well I went to order a smaller size and was shocked that they were double the cost. So I returned them and ordered two other styles in 3 different sizes, only to keep one pair in a size 7. I still wanted these but at the $40 price point, so I watched and waited. While waiting, returning other pairs, and reading ALL reviews I had a better idea of the size that would probably work. Obviously the size chart wasn‚Äôt accurate and didn‚Äôt help the first time. Finally after after 2 months the price dropped and I ordered the replacement pair in a size 6.5. I tried them on and they are still a little big even with thick socks on but not bad enough for another return. A size 6 would be perfect with toe wiggle room but these will work. They are extremely padded especially around the Achilles tendon and ankle portion. The cushion almost has a ‚Äúgel‚Äù padding feel and surrounds the outer part of the foot. So my other pairs of Adidas sneakers range from a 5 to a 7! This brand doesn‚Äôt seem to be consistent with size but are worth it when you find your fit. These are noticeably heavier on then most sneakers but that is do to the really thick shock absorbing sole and the padding. However it‚Äôs not heavy enough for me to give up the comfort. I have clubbed toes on my left foot and this shoe doesn‚Äôt bother me. So in conclusion I went from a 7.5 down to a 6.5 and could‚Äôve easily worn a 6! So I would suggest sizing down at least a half size down minimal. I expect they‚Äôll last me at least a year or more easily with this being used as a primary daily shoe.

The comfort of the shoe is 5 stars, it\'s like working out on a cloud, and I don\'t say that lightly. The shoe hits 5 stars for everything BUT..the sizing. It\'s never easy going through sizing discrepancy reviews because there\'s never enough detail or comparison, I\'m gonna give you some. The size 10 shoe, is going for $26, 2 weeks ago, I ordered the 9.5 and it was on sale for $39. Now 9.5 is up & the size 9, only the size 10 is for $26 because the sizing is so off I\'ll bet they are stuck with a bunch of returns and regular inventory for that size. I got the 9.5 cheaper than it is now and I think the price went up because normal size 10 wearers grew aware of this so went for the next size down, and the one after that, driving the price up, which is my only issue with this product or seller. Shoes should be the same price across the board like they\'ve always been but consumers are now having to pay more for the sellers not being detailed enough in their product as to write a product description that would aide consumers in choosing the right size and lowering returns & exchanges. I am normally between a 9.5 & 10 shoe size. For heels it\'s usually a 10, with the rare shoe still being too small. For a tennis shoe it\'s usually a 9.5 as a 10 is usually too big, except for the rare occasion it\'s just right. To give you an idea of my foot: I am 5\'9, 130lbs, I am built long, bony, & muscular but my hands & feet don\'t have an ounce of fattie tissue on them & they don\'t swell. When a shoe fits, ot fits, when it doesn\'t, it doesnt. This shoe surprised the heck out of me because I don\'t remember the last time a size 9.5 sneaker felt like a 10.5. I can get away with the 9.5 because I\'ve put a shoe insert in & I wear thick socks & the laces tie up very securely, which is another plus. My workouts are going just fine save for the stairmaster. I hate dealing with exchanges & returns so if I can make it work then I will, so thankfully, I could make due-but, I want others to know why the price discrepancy differences and what shoe size may work. If you are built bony like me but also have gunboats for feet, I would say go a full size down. Even me going to my usual 9.5, my lowest size, was barely doable, only so because I\'ve got a good thick insole insert. If you have thicker feet, I\'d say go half a size down because with this shoe it\'s not the width of the shoe that\'s the problem, the shoe cinches up & loosens great, it\'s the length of the shoe that\'s inaccurate. I still recommend this shoe, but I am a gym rat & go through sneakers like crazy so I\'ll get a new pair when I run through these, that\'s how much I love them. I hope this review helps and I hope I was detailed enough because it always bothers me when I don\'t know the body style of the person who is saying ""too big/too small, too tall/too short"", etc, because it does make a difference, for comparative purposes. It\'s for this lone reason that I give the shoe 4 stars instead of 5, because it was just too far off base. Hope this helps, everyone!', 'rating': '4.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'Loved them', 'rating': '5.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': ""I tried these b/c the reviews said they were so comfortable. (I actually tried the Boys X_PLR Boost Sneaker on in the big kids size at a shoe store, and they were very comfortable, but I would have needed a boys size 7 and they did not have it).These X_PLR Phase women's sneakers are not as cushy comfortable as the X_PLR Boost big kids version. The reviews stated they run large so I sized down: I normally wear 8.5 to 9 in women's shoes so I tried it in a size 8, which fit snug in the toes, but b/c these slant downwards from back to front then my foot was pushed downwards on the downward slant right into the toes, and the toes have rubber around the edge in the front which is hard, so it just pushed my toes downward into the front of the shoe,  and it was too tight in the toes, and then too loose in the heels on me.I felt ordering a half size up they would be too big.Also, I did not find that the cushioned soles on these were as cushiony as the X_PLR Boost big kids version, the 'Phase' seems less 'cushy' than the 'Boost'  X_PLR.As stated in other reviews,  the back of the heel is so-o-o big, and sticks out so far surrounding your heel, some said 'like clown shoes,' that I did not like the way this looked as well.So back these go, and still trying to find some women's sneakers that fit and are comfortable."", 'rating': '3.0 out of 5 stars'} {'review': 'Super comfortable, Very cute and such a ladylike shoe!!
